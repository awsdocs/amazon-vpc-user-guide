# AWS services that integrate with AWS PrivateLink<a name="integrated-services-vpce-list"></a>

The following services integrate with AWS PrivateLink\. You can create an [interface endpoint](vpce-interface.md) to connect to these services\.

The **VPC endpoint policies** column displays " ![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/images/icon-no.png) No", when the service integrates with AWS PrivateLink, but does not support VPC endpoint policies\. Choose the "Yes" link to see the documentation for services that support VPC endpoint policies\.

## View available AWS service names<a name="vpce-view-available-services"></a>

You can use the [describe\-vpc\-endpoint\-services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-vpc-endpoint-services.html) command to view the service names that support VPC endpoints\.

You can run the following command to get a list of the service names for gateway or interface endpoints\. The `--query` option limits the output to the service names

```
aws ec2 describe-vpc-endpoint-services --filter Name=service-type,Values=service-type --query ServiceNames
```

The following example displays the services that support interface endpoints\. 

```
aws ec2 describe-vpc-endpoint-services --filter Name=service-type,Values=Interface --query ServiceNames
```

Output

```
    "aws.sagemaker.us-east-1.notebook",
    "aws.sagemaker.us-east-1.studio",
    "com.amazonaws.us-east-1.access-analyzer",
    "com.amazonaws.us-east-1.acm-pca",
    "com.amazonaws.us-east-1.airflow.api",
    "com.amazonaws.us-east-1.airflow.env",
    "com.amazonaws.us-east-1.airflow.ops",
    "com.amazonaws.us-east-1.application-autoscaling",
    "com.amazonaws.us-east-1.appmesh-envoy-management",
    "com.amazonaws.us-east-1.appstream.api",
    "com.amazonaws.us-east-1.appstream.streaming",
    "com.amazonaws.us-east-1.aps-workspaces",
    "com.amazonaws.us-east-1.athena",
    "com.amazonaws.us-east-1.auditmanager",
    "com.amazonaws.us-east-1.autoscaling",
    "com.amazonaws.us-east-1.autoscaling-plans",
    "com.amazonaws.us-east-1.awsconnector",
...
```

After you have the service name, you can view detailed information by running the following command\.

```
aws ec2 describe-vpc-endpoint-services --filter "Name=service-type,Values=service-type" Name=service-name,Values=service-name
```

The following example displays the the information about the Amazon S3 interface endpoint that has a service name of "com\.amazonaws\.us\-east\-1\.s3 "

```
aws ec2 describe-vpc-endpoint-services --filter "Name=service-type,Values=Interface" Name=service-name,Values=com.amazonaws.us-east-1.s3
```

Output

```
