# Working with route tables<a name="WorkWithRouteTables"></a>

The following tasks show you how to work with route tables\.

**Note**  
When you use the VPC wizard in the console to create a VPC with a gateway, the wizard automatically updates the route tables to use the gateway\. If you're using the command line tools or API to set up your VPC, you must update the route tables yourself\.

## Determining which route table a subnet is associated with<a name="SubnetRouteTables"></a>

You can determine which route table a subnet is associated with by looking at the subnet details in the Amazon VPC console\.

**To determine which route table a subnet is associated with**

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Subnets**\.

1. Choose the **Route Table** tab to view the route table ID and its routes\. If it's the main route table, the console doesn't indicate whether the association is implicit or explicit\. To determine if the association to the main route table is explicit, see [Determining which subnets and or gateways are explicitly associated with a table](#Route_Which_Associations)\.

## Determining which subnets and or gateways are explicitly associated with a table<a name="Route_Which_Associations"></a>

You can determine how many and which subnets or gateways are explicitly associated with a route table\. 

The main route table can have explicit and implicit subnet associations\. Custom route tables have only explicit associations\.

Subnets that aren't explicitly associated with any route table have an implicit association with the main route table\. You can explicitly associate a subnet with the main route table\. For an example of why you might do that, see [Replacing the main route table](#Route_Replacing_Main_Table)\.

**To determine which subnets are explicitly associated using the console**

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Route Tables**\.

1. View the **Explicit subnet association** column to determine the explicitly associated subnets\.

1. Select the required route table\.

1. Choose the **Subnet Associations** tab in the details pane\. The subnets explicitly associated with the table are listed on the tab\. Any subnets not associated with any route table \(and thus implicitly associated with the main route table\) are also listed\.

**To determine which gateways are explicitly associated using the console**

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Route Tables**\.

1. View the **Edge associations** column to determine the associated gateways\.

1. Select the required route table\.

1. Choose the **Edge Associations** tab in the details pane\. The gateways that are associated with the route table are listed\.

**To describe one or more route tables and view its associations using the command line**
+ [describe\-route\-tables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-route-tables.html) \(AWS CLI\)
+ [Get\-EC2RouteTable](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Get-EC2RouteTable.html) \(AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell\)

## Creating a custom route table<a name="CustomRouteTable"></a>

You can create a custom route table for your VPC using the Amazon VPC console\.

**To create a custom route table using the console**

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Route Tables**\.

1. Choose **Create route table**\.

1. \(Optional\) For **Name tag**, enter a name for your route table\. 

1. For **VPC**, choose your VPC\. 

1. \(Optional\) Add or remove a tag\.

   \[Add a tag\] Choose **Add tag** and do the following:
   + For **Key**, enter the key name\.
   + For **Value**, enter the key value\.

   \[Remove a tag\] Choose the Delete button \("X"\) to the right of the tagâ€™s Key and Value\.

1. Choose **Create**\.

**To create a custom route table using the command line**

## Associating a subnet with a route table<a name="AssociateSubnet"></a>

To apply route table routes to a particular subnet, you must associate the route table with the subnet\. A route table can be associated with multiple subnets\. However, a subnet can only be associated with one route table at a time\. Any subnet not explicitly associated with a table is implicitly associated with the main route table by default\.

## Replacing and restoring the target for a local route<a name="replace-local-route-target"></a>

You can change the target of the default local route in a [gateway route table](VPC_Route_Tables.md#gateway-route-table) and specify a network interface or instance in the same VPC as the target instead\. If you replace the target of a local route, you can later restore it to the default `local` target\. If your VPC has [multiple CIDR blocks](VPC_Subnets.md#vpc-resize), your route tables have multiple local routesâ€”one per CIDR block\. You can replace or restore the target of each of the local routes as needed\.

You cannot replace the target for a local route in a subnet route table\.

**To replace the target for a local route using the console**

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Route Tables**, and then select the route table\.

1. Choose **Actions**, **Edit routes**\.

1. For **Target**, choose **Network Interface** to display the list of network interfaces, and choose the network interface\.

   Alternatively, choose **Instance** to display the list of instances, and choose the instance\.

1. Choose **Save routes**\.

**To restore the target for a local route using the console**

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Route Tables**, and then select the route table\.

1. Choose **Actions**, **Edit routes**\.

1. For **Target**, choose **local**\.

1. Choose **Save routes**\.

**To replace the target for a local route using the AWS CLI**  
Use the [replace\-route](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/replace-route.html) command\. The following example replaces the target of the local route with `eni-11223344556677889`\.

```
aws ec2 replace-route --route-table-id rtb-01234567890123456 --destination-cidr-block 10.0.0.0/16 --network-interface-id eni-11223344556677889
```

**To restore the target for a local route using the AWS CLI**  
The following example restores the local target for route table `rtb-01234567890123456`\.

```
aws ec2 replace-route --route-table-id rtb-01234567890123456 --destination-cidr-block 10.0.0.0/16 --local-target
```
