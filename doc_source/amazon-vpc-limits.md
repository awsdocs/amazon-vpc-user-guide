# Amazon VPC quotas<a name="amazon-vpc-limits"></a>

The following tables list the quotas, formerly referred to as limits, for Amazon VPC resources per Region for your AWS account\. Unless indicated otherwise, you can [request an increase](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase&limitType=vpc) for these quotas\. For some of these quotas, you can view your current quota using the **Limits** page of the Amazon EC2 console\.

If you request a quota increase that applies per resource, we increase the quota for all resources in the Region\. 

## VPC and subnets<a name="vpc-limits-vpcs-subnets"></a>


| Resource | Default | Comments | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  VPCs per Region  |  5  |  The quota for internet gateways per Region is directly correlated to this one\. Increasing this quota increases the quota on internet gateways per Region by the same amount\. You can have 100s of VPCs per Region for your needs even though the default quota is 5 VPCs per Region\.  | 
|  Subnets per VPC  |  200  |  \-  | 
| IPv4 CIDR blocks per VPC | 5 | This primary CIDR block and all secondary CIDR blocks count toward this quota\. This quota can be increased up to a maximum of 50\. | 
|  IPv6 CIDR blocks per VPC  |  1  |  This quota cannot be increased\.  | 

## DNS<a name="vpc-limits-dns"></a>

Each EC2 instance limits the number of packets that can be sent to the Amazon Route 53 Resolver \(specifically the \.2 address, such as 10\.0\.0\.2\) to a maximum of 1024 packets per second per network interface\. This quota cannot be increased\. The number of DNS queries per second supported by the Amazon Route 53 Resolver varies by the type of query, the size of response, and the protocol in use\. For more information and recommendations for a scalable DNS architecture, see the [Hybrid Cloud DNS Solutions for Amazon VPC](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/hybrid-cloud-dns-options-for-vpc.pdf) whitepaper\.

## Elastic IP addresses \(IPv4\)<a name="vpc-limits-eips"></a>


| Resource | Default | Comments | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  Elastic IP addresses per Region  |  5  |  This is the quota for the number of Elastic IP addresses for use in EC2\-VPC\. For Elastic IP addresses for use in EC2\-Classic, see [Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud Endpoints and Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/ec2-service.html) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*\. This quota applies to individual AWS account VPCs and shared VPCs\.  | 

## Gateways<a name="vpc-limits-gateways"></a>


| Resource | Default | Comments |

|  Customer gateways per Region  |  \-  |  For more information, see [Site\-to\-Site VPN Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/vpn-limits.html) in the *AWS Site\-to\-Site VPN User Guide*\.  | 
| Egress\-only internet gateways per Region | 5 | This quota is directly correlated with the quota on VPCs per Region\. To increase this quota, increase the quota on VPCs per Region\. You can attach only one egress\-only internet gateway to a VPC at a time\. | 
|  Internet gateways per Region  |  5  |  This quota is directly correlated with the quota on VPCs per Region\. To increase this quota, increase the quota on VPCs per Region\. Only one internet gateway can be attached to a VPC at a time\.  | 
| NAT gateways per Availability Zone | 5 | A NAT gateway in the pending, active, or deleting state counts against your quota\. | 
|  Virtual private gateways per Region  |  \-  |  For more information, see [Site\-to\-Site VPN Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/vpn-limits.html) in the *AWS Site\-to\-Site VPN User Guide*\.   |

## Customer\-managed prefix lists<a name="vpc-quotas-managed-prefix-lists"></a>


| Resource | Default | Comments | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  Prefix lists per Region  |  100  |  \-  | 
|  Versions per prefix list  |  1,000  |  In the scenario where a prefix list has 1,000 stored versions and you add a new version, the oldest version is removed to allow the new version to be added and remain within the quota\.  | 
|  Maximum number of entries per prefix list | 1,000 |  | 
|  References to a prefix list per resource type  |  5,000  |  This quota applies per resource type that can reference a prefix list\. For example, you can have 5,000 references to a prefix list across all of your security groups plus 5,000 references to a prefix list across all of your subnet route tables\. If you share a prefix list with other AWS accounts, the other accounts' references to your prefix list count toward this quota\.  | 

## Network ACLs<a name="vpc-limits-nacls"></a>


| Resource | Default | Comments | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  Network ACLs per VPC  |  200  |  You can associate one network ACL to one or more subnets in a VPC\. This quota is not the same as the number of rules per network ACL\.  | 
|  Rules per network ACL  | 20 |  This is the one\-way quota for a single network ACL\. This quota is enforced separately for IPv4 rules and IPv6 rules; for example, you can have 20 ingress rules for IPv4 traffic and 20 ingress rules for IPv6 traffic\. This quota includes the default deny rules \(rule number 32767 for IPv4 and 32768 for IPv6, or an asterisk \* in the Amazon VPC console\)\.  This quota can be increased up to a maximum of 40; however, network performance might be impacted due to the increased workload to process the additional rules\.  | 

## Network interfaces<a name="vpc-limits-enis"></a>


| Resource | Default | Comments | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Network interfaces per instance | \- | This quota varies by instance type\. For more information, see [IP Addresses Per ENI Per Instance Type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html#AvailableIpPerENI)\. | 
| Network interfaces per Region | 5000 | This quota applies to individual AWS account VPCs and shared VPCs\. | 

## Route tables<a name="vpc-limits-route-tables"></a>


| Resource | Default | Comments | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  Route tables per VPC  |  200  |  The main route table counts toward this quota\.  | 
|  Routes per route table \(non\-propagated routes\)  |  50  |  You can increase this quota up to a maximum of 1,000; however, network performance might be impacted\. This quota is enforced separately for IPv4 routes and IPv6 routes\.  If you have more than 125 routes, we recommend that you paginate calls to describe your route tables for better performance\.  If you reference a customer\-managed prefix list in a route, the maximum number of entries for the prefix lists equals the same number of routes\.  | 
|  BGP advertised routes per route table \(propagated routes\)  |  100  |  This quota cannot be increased\. If you require more than 100 prefixes, advertise a default route\.  | 

## Security groups<a name="vpc-limits-security-groups"></a>


| Resource | Default | Comments | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  VPC security groups per Region  |  2500  |  This quota applies to individual AWS account VPCs and shared VPCs\. If you increase this quota to more than 5000 security groups in a Region, we recommend that you paginate calls to describe your security groups for better performance\.  | 
|  Inbound or outbound rules per security group   |  60  |  You can have 60 inbound and 60 outbound rules per security group \(making a total of 120 rules\)\. This quota is enforced separately for IPv4 rules and IPv6 rules; for example, a security group can have 60 inbound rules for IPv4 traffic and 60 inbound rules for IPv6 traffic\. A rule that references a security group or AWS\-managed prefix list ID counts as one rule for IPv4 and one rule for IPv6\. A quota change applies to both inbound and outbound rules\. This quota multiplied by the quota for security groups per network interface cannot exceed 1000\. For example, if you increase this quota to 100, we decrease the quota for your number of security groups per network interface to 10\. If you reference a customer\-managed prefix list in a security group rule, the maximum number of entries for the prefix lists equals the same number of security group rules\.  | 
|  Security groups per network interface  |  5  |  The maximum is 16\. This quota is enforced separately for IPv4 rules and IPv6 rules\. The quota for security groups per network interface multiplied by the quota for rules per security group cannot exceed 1000\. For example, if you increase this quota to 10, we decrease the quota for your number of rules per security group to 100\.  | 

## VPC peering connections<a name="vpc-limits-peering"></a>


| Resource | Default | Comments | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Active VPC peering connections per VPC |  50  |  The maximum quota is 125 peering connections per VPC\. The number of entries per route table should be increased accordingly; however, network performance might be impacted\.  | 
|  Outstanding VPC peering connection requests  | 25 |  This is the quota for the number of outstanding VPC peering connection requests that you've requested from your account\.  | 
|  Expiry time for an unaccepted VPC peering connection request  |  1 week \(168 hours\)  |  This quota cannot be increased\.  | 

## VPC endpoints<a name="vpc-limits-endpoints"></a>


| Resource | Default | Comments | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Gateway VPC endpoints per Region | 20 | You cannot have more than 255 gateway endpoints per VPC\. | 
| Interface and Gateway Load Balancer endpoints per VPC | 50 | This is the combined quota for the maximum number of interface endpoints and Gateway Load Balancer endpoints in a VPC\. To increase this quota, contact AWS Support\.  | 
|  VPC endpoint policy size  | 20,480 characters \(including white space\) | This quota cannot be increased\. | 

The following maximum transmission unit \(MTU\) rules apply to traffic that passes through a VPC endpoint\.
+ The maximum transmission unit \(MTU\) of a network connection is the size, in bytes, of the largest permissible packet that can be passed through the VPC endpoint\. The larger the MTU, the more data that can be passed in a single packet\. A VPC endpoint supports an MTU of 8500 bytes\.
+ Packets with a size larger than 8500 bytes that arrive at the VPC endpoint are dropped\.
+ The VPC endpoint does not generate the FRAG\_NEEDEDICMP packet, so Path MTU Discovery \(PMTUD\) is not supported\.
+ The VPC endpoint enforces Maximum Segment Size \(MSS\) clamping for all packets\. For more information, see [RFC879](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc879)\.

## VPC sharing<a name="vpc-share-limits"></a>

All standard VPC quotas apply to a shared VPC\.


| Resource | Default | Comments | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  Participant accounts per VPC  |   100  | This is the quota for the number of distinct participant accounts that subnets in a VPC can be shared with\. This is a per VPC quota and applies across all the subnets shared in a VPC\. To increase this quota, contact AWS Support\. VPC owners can view the network interfaces and security groups that are attached to the participant resources\. Therefore, AWS recommends that you paginate your `DescribeSecurityGroups` and `DescribeNetworkInterfaces` API calls before requesting an increase for this quota\. | 
| Subnets that can be shared with an account |  100 |  This is the quota for maximum number of subnets that can be shared with an AWS account\. To increase this quota contact AWS Support\. AWS recommends that you paginate your `DescribeSecurityGroups` and `DescribeSubnets` API calls before requesting an increase for this quota\.   |
