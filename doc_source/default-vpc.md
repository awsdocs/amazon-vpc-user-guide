# Default VPC and default subnets<a name="default-vpc"></a>

If you created your AWS account after 2013\-12\-04, it supports only EC2\-VPC\. In this case, you have a *default VPC* in each AWS Region\. A default VPC is ready for you to use so that you don't have to create and configure your own VPC\. You can immediately start launching Amazon EC2 instances into your default VPC\. You can also use services such as Elastic Load Balancing, Amazon RDS, and Amazon EMR in your default VPC\.

A default VPC is suitable for getting started quickly, and for launching public instances such as a blog or simple website\. You can modify the components of your default VPC as needed\. If you prefer to create a nondefault VPC that suits your specific requirements; for example, using your preferred CIDR block range and subnet sizes, see the [example scenarios](VPC_Scenarios.md)\.

## Default VPC components<a name="default-vpc-components"></a>

When we create a default VPC, we do the following to set it up for you:
+ Create a VPC with a size `/16` IPv4 CIDR block \(`172.31.0.0/16`\)\. This provides up to 65,536 private IPv4 addresses\. 
+ Create a size `/20` default subnet in each Availability Zone\. This provides up to 4,096 addresses per subnet, a few of which are reserved for our use\.
+ Create an [internet gateway](VPC_Internet_Gateway.md) and connect it to your default VPC\.
+ Add a route to the main route table that points all traffic \(`0.0.0.0/0`\) to the internet gateway\.
+ Create a default security group and associate it with your default VPC\.
+ Create a default network access control list \(ACL\) and associate it with your default VPC\.
+ Associate the default DHCP options set for your AWS account with your default VPC\.

**Note**  
Amazon creates the above resources on your behalf\. IAM policies do not apply to these actions because you do not perform these actions\. For example, if you have an IAM policy that denies the ability to call CreateInternetGateway, and then you call CreateDefaultVpc, the internet gateway in the default VPC is still created\.

The following figure illustrates the key components that we set up for a default VPC\.

![\[A default VPC\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/images/default-vpc-diagram.png)

You can use a default VPC as you would use any other VPC: 
+ Add additional nondefault subnets\.
+ Modify the main route table\.
+ Add additional route tables\.
+ Associate additional security groups\.
+ Update the rules of the default security group\.
+ Add AWS Site\-to\-Site VPN connections\.
+ Add more IPv4 CIDR blocks\.
+ Access VPCs in a remote Region by using a Direct Connect gateway\. For information about Direct Connect gateway options, see [Direct Connect gateways](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/direct-connect-gateways-intro.html) in the *AWS Direct Connect User Guide*\.

You can use a default subnet as you would use any other subnet; add custom route tables and set network ACLs\. You can also specify a specific default subnet when you launch an EC2 instance\.

You can optionally associate an IPv6 CIDR block with your default VPC\. For more information, [Working with VPCs and subnets](working-with-vpcs.md)\.

### Default subnets<a name="default-subnet"></a>

By default, a default subnet is a public subnet, because the main route table sends the subnet's traffic that is destined for the internet to the internet gateway\. You can make a default subnet into a private subnet by removing the route from the destination 0\.0\.0\.0/0 to the internet gateway\. However, if you do this, no EC2 instance running in that subnet can access the internet\. 

Instances that you launch into a default subnet receive both a public IPv4 address and a private IPv4 address, and both public and private DNS hostnames\. Instances that you launch into a nondefault subnet in a default VPC don't receive a public IPv4 address or a DNS hostname\. You can change your subnet's default public IP addressing behavior\. For more information, see [Modifying the public IPv4 addressing attribute for your subnet](vpc-ip-addressing.md#subnet-public-ip)\.

From time to time, AWS may add a new Availability Zone to a Region\. In most cases, we automatically create a new default subnet in this Availability Zone for your default VPC within a few days\. However, if you made any modifications to your default VPC, we do not add a new default subnet\. If you want a default subnet for the new Availability Zone, you can create one yourself\. For more information, see [Creating a default subnet](#create-default-subnet)\.

## Availability and supported platforms<a name="default-vpc-availability"></a>

If you created your AWS account after 2013\-12\-04, it supports only EC2\-VPC and you have a default VPC in each AWS Region\. Therefore, unless you create a nondefault VPC and specify it when you launch an instance, we launch your instances into your default VPC\.

If you created your AWS account before 2013\-03\-18, it supports both [EC2\-Classic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-classic-platform.html) and EC2\-VPC in Regions that you've used before, and only EC2\-VPC in Regions that you haven't used\. In this case, we create a default VPC in each Region in which you haven't created any AWS resources\. Unless you create a nondefault VPC and specify it when you launch an instance in a new Region, we launch the instance into your default VPC for that Region\. However, if you launch an instance in a Region that you've used before, we launch the instance into EC2\-Classic\.

If you created your AWS account between 2013\-03\-18 and 2013\-12\-04, it may support only EC2\-VPC\. Alternatively, it may support both EC2\-Classic and EC2\-VPC in some of the Regions that you've used\. For information about detecting the platform support in each Region for your AWS account, see [Detecting supported platforms](#detecting-platform)\. For information about when each Region was enabled for default VPCs, see [Announcement: Enabling Regions for the default VPC feature set](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/ann.jspa?annID=1875#) in the AWS forum for Amazon VPC\.

If an AWS account supports only EC2\-VPC, any IAM accounts associated with this AWS account also support only EC2\-VPC, and use the same default VPC as the AWS account\.

If your AWS account supports both EC2\-Classic and EC2\-VPC, you can either create a new AWS account or launch your instances into a Region that you haven't used before\. You might do this to get the benefits of using EC2\-VPC with the simplicity of launching instances into EC2\-Classic\. If you'd still prefer to add a default VPC to a Region that doesn't have one and supports EC2\-Classic, see "I really want a default VPC for my existing EC2 account\. Is that possible?" in the [Default VPCs FAQ](http://aws.amazon.com/vpc/faqs/#Default_VPCs)\.

### Detecting supported platforms<a name="detecting-platform"></a>

 You can use the Amazon EC2 console or the command line to determine whether your AWS account supports both platforms, or if you have a default VPC\.

**To detect platform support using the Amazon EC2 console**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. In the navigation bar, use the Region selector on the top right to select your Region\.

1. On the Amazon EC2 console dashboard, look for **Supported Platforms** under **Account Attributes**\. If there are two values, `EC2` and `VPC`, you can launch instances into either platform\. If there is one value, `VPC`, you can launch instances only into EC2\-VPC\.

   For example, the following indicates that the account supports the EC2\-VPC platform only, and has a default VPC with the identifier `vpc-1a2b3c4d`\.  
![\[The Supported Platforms indicator.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/images/vpc_indicator.png)

   If you delete your default VPC, the **Default VPC** value displayed is `None`\.

**To detect platform support using the command line**
+ [describe\-account\-attributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-account-attributes.html) \(AWS CLI\)
+ [Get\-EC2AccountAttribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Get-EC2AccountAttribute.html) \(AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell\)

The `supported-platforms` attribute in the output indicates which platforms you can launch EC2 instances into\.

## Viewing your default VPC and default subnets<a name="view-default-vpc"></a>

You can view your default VPC and subnets using the Amazon VPC console or the command line\.

**To view your default VPC and subnets using the Amazon VPC console**

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Your VPCs**\.

1. In the **Default VPC** column, look for a value of **Yes**\. Take note of the ID of the default VPC\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Subnets**\.

1. In the search bar, type the ID of the default VPC\. The returned subnets are subnets in your default VPC\.

1. To verify which subnets are default subnets, look for a value of **Yes** in the **Default Subnet **column\.

**To describe your default VPC using the command line**
+ Use the [describe\-vpcs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-vpcs.html) \(AWS CLI\)
+ Use the [Get\-EC2Vpc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Get-EC2Vpc.html) \(AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell\)

Use the commands with the `isDefault` filter and set the filter value to `true`\. 

**To describe your default subnets using the command line**
+ Use the [describe\-subnets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-subnets.html) \(AWS CLI\)
+ Use the [Get\-EC2Subnet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Get-EC2Subnet.html) \(AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell\)

Use the commands with the `vpc-id` filter and set the filter value to the ID of the default VPC\. In the output, the `DefaultForAz` field is set to `true` for default subnets\.

## Launching an EC2 instance into your default VPC<a name="launching-into"></a>

When you launch an EC2 instance without specifying a subnet, it's automatically launched into a default subnet in your default VPC\. By default, we select an Availability Zone for you and launch the instance into the corresponding subnet for that Availability Zone\. Alternatively, you can select the Availability Zone for your instance by selecting its corresponding default subnet in the console, or by specifying the subnet or the Availability Zone in the AWS CLI\. 

### Launching an EC2 instance using the console<a name="launching-into-console"></a>

**To launch an EC2 instance into your default VPC**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. From the EC2 dashboard, choose **Launch Instance**\.

1. Follow the directions in the wizard\. Select an AMI, and choose an instance type\. You can accept the default settings for the rest of the wizard by choosing **Review and Launch**\. This takes you directly to the **Review Instance Launch** page\. 

1. Review your settings\. In the **Instance Details** section, the default for **Subnet** is **No preference \(default subnet in any Availability Zone\)**\. This means that the instance is launched into the default subnet of the Availability Zone that we select\. Alternatively, choose **Edit instance details** and select the default subnet for a particular Availability Zone\.

1. Choose **Launch** to choose a key pair and launch the instance\.

### Launching an EC2 instance using the command line<a name="launching-into-cli"></a>

You can use one of the following commands to launch an EC2 instance:
+ [run\-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/run-instances.html) \(AWS CLI\)
+ [New\-EC2Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/New-EC2Instance.html) \(AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell\)

To launch an EC2 instance into your default VPC, use these commands without specifying a subnet or an Availability Zone\.

To launch an EC2 instance into a specific default subnet in your default VPC, specify its subnet ID or Availability Zone\.

## Deleting your default subnets and default VPC<a name="deleting-default-vpc"></a>

You can delete a default subnet or default VPC just as you can delete any other subnet or VPC\. For more information, see [Working with VPCs and subnets](working-with-vpcs.md)\. However, if you delete your default subnets or default VPC, you must explicitly specify a subnet in another VPC in which to launch your instance, because you can't launch instances into EC2\-Classic\. If you do not have another VPC, you must create a nondefault VPC and nondefault subnet\. For more information, see [Creating a VPC](working-with-vpcs.md#Create-VPC)\. 

If you delete your default VPC, you can create a new one\. For more information, see [Creating a default VPC](#create-default-vpc)\. 

If you delete a default subnet, you can create a new one\. For more information, see [Creating a default subnet](#create-default-subnet)\. Alternatively, you can create a nondefault subnet in your default VPC and contact AWS Support to mark the subnet as a default subnet\. You must provide the following details: your AWS account ID, the Region, and the subnet ID\. To ensure that your new default subnet behaves as expected, modify the subnet attribute to assign public IP addresses to instances that are launched in that subnet\. For more information, see [Modifying the public IPv4 addressing attribute for your subnet](vpc-ip-addressing.md#subnet-public-ip)\. You can only have one default subnet per Availability Zone\. You cannot create a default subnet in a nondefault VPC\. 

## Creating a default VPC<a name="create-default-vpc"></a>

If you delete your default VPC, you can create a new one\. You cannot restore a previous default VPC that you deleted, and you cannot mark an existing nondefault VPC as a default VPC\. If your account supports EC2\-Classic, you cannot use these procedures to create a default VPC in a Region that supports EC2\-Classic\.

When you create a default VPC, it is created with the standard [components](#default-vpc-components) of a default VPC, including a default subnet in each Availability Zone\. You cannot specify your own components\. The subnet CIDR blocks of your new default VPC may not map to the same Availability Zones as your previous default VPC\. For example, if the subnet with CIDR block `172.31.0.0/20` was created in `us-east-2a` in your previous default VPC, it may be created in `us-east-2b` in your new default VPC\.

If you already have a default VPC in the Region, you cannot create another one\. 

**To create a default VPC using the Amazon VPC console**

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Your VPCs**\.

1. Choose **Actions**, **Create Default VPC**\.

1. Choose **Create**\. Close the confirmation screen\.

**To create a default VPC using the command line**
+ You can use the [create\-default\-vpc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-default-vpc.html) AWS CLI command\. This command does not have any input parameters\.

  ```
  aws ec2 create-default-vpc
  ```

  ```
  {
      "Vpc": {
          "VpcId": "vpc-3f139646", 
          "InstanceTenancy": "default", 
          "Tags": [], 
          "Ipv6CidrBlockAssociationSet": [], 
          "State": "pending", 
          "DhcpOptionsId": "dopt-61079b07", 
          "CidrBlock": "172.31.0.0/16", 
          "IsDefault": true
      }
  }
  ```

Alternatively, you can use the [New\-EC2DefaultVpc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/New-EC2DefaultVpc.html) Tools for Windows PowerShell command or the [CreateDefaultVpc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDefaultVpc.html) Amazon EC2 API action\.

## Creating a default subnet<a name="create-default-subnet"></a>

You can create a default subnet in an Availability Zone that does not have one\. For example, you might want to create a default subnet if you have deleted a default subnet, or if AWS has added a new Availability Zone and did not automatically create a default subnet for that zone in your default VPC\. 

When you create a default subnet, it is created with a size `/20` IPv4 CIDR block in the next available contiguous space in your default VPC\. The following rules apply:
+ You cannot specify the CIDR block yourself\.
+ You cannot restore a previous default subnet that you deleted\.
+ You can have only one default subnet per Availability Zone\.
+ You cannot create a default subnet in a nondefault VPC\.

If there is not enough address space in your default VPC to create a size `/20` CIDR block, the request fails\. If you need more address space, you can [add an IPv4 CIDR block to your VPC](VPC_Subnets.md#vpc-resize)\.

If you've associated an IPv6 CIDR block with your default VPC, the new default subnet does not automatically receive an IPv6 CIDR block\. Instead, you can associate an IPv6 CIDR block with the default subnet after you create it\. For more information, see [Associating an IPv6 CIDR block with your subnet](working-with-vpcs.md#subnet-associate-ipv6-cidr)\.

Currently, you can create a default subnet using the AWS CLI, an AWS SDK, or the Amazon EC2 API only\.

**To create a default subnet using the AWS CLI**
+ Use the [create\-default\-subnet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-default-subnet.html) AWS CLI command and specify the Availability Zone in which to create the subnet\.

  ```
  aws ec2 create-default-subnet --availability-zone us-east-2a
  ```

  ```
  {
      "Subnet": {
          "AvailabilityZone": "us-east-2a", 
          "Tags": [], 
          "AvailableIpAddressCount": 4091, 
          "DefaultForAz": true, 
          "Ipv6CidrBlockAssociationSet": [], 
          "VpcId": "vpc-1a2b3c4d", 
          "State": "available", 
          "MapPublicIpOnLaunch": true, 
          "SubnetId": "subnet-1122aabb", 
          "CidrBlock": "172.31.32.0/20", 
          "AssignIpv6AddressOnCreation": false
      }
  }
  ```

  For more information about setting up the AWS CLI, see the [AWS Command Line Interface User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/)\.

  Alternatively, you can use the [New\-EC2DefaultSubnet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/New-EC2DefaultSubnet.html) Tools for Windows PowerShell command or the [CreateDefaultSubnet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDefaultSubnet.html) Amazon EC2 API action\.
