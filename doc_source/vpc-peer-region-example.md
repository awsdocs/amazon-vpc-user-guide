# Examples: Services using AWS PrivateLink and VPC peering<a name="vpc-peer-region-example"></a>

An AWS PrivateLink service provider configures instances running services in their VPC, with a Network Load Balancer as the front end\. Use intra\-region VPC peering \(VPCs are in the same Region\) and inter\-region VPC peering \(VPCs are in different Regions\) with AWS PrivateLink to allow private access to consumers across VPC peering connections\.

Consumers in remote VPCs cannot use Private DNS names across peering connections\. They can however create their own private hosted zone on Route 53, and attach it to their VPCs to use the same Private DNS name\. For information about using transit gateway with Amazon RouteÂ 53 Resolver, to share PrivateLink interface endpoints between multiple connected VPCs and an on\-premises environment, see [Integrating AWS Transit Gateway with AWS PrivateLink and Amazon Route 53 Resolver](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/integrating-aws-transit-gateway-with-aws-privatelink-and-amazon-route-53-resolver/)\.

The following are example configurations using AWS PrivateLink and VPC peering\.
