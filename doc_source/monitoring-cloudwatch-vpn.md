# Monitoring with Amazon CloudWatch<a name="monitoring-cloudwatch-vpn"></a>

You can monitor VPN tunnels using CloudWatch, which collects and processes raw data from the VPN service into readable, near real\-time metrics\. These statistics are recorded for a period of 15 months, so that you can access historical information and gain a better perspective on how your web application or service is performing\. VPN metric data is automatically sent to CloudWatch as it becomes available\.

**Important**  
CloudWatch metrics are not supported for AWS Classic VPN connections\. For more information, see [AWS Managed VPN Categories](VPC_VPN.md#vpn-categories)\.

For more information, see the [Amazon CloudWatch User Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/)\.

## VPN Metrics and Dimensions<a name="metrics-dimensions-vpn"></a>

When you create a new VPN connection, the VPN service sends the following metrics about your VPN tunnels to CloudWatch as it becomes available\. You can use the following procedures to view the metrics for VPN tunnels\.

**To view metrics using the CloudWatch console**

Metrics are grouped first by the service namespace, and then by the various dimension combinations within each namespace\.

1. Open the CloudWatch console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Metrics**\.

1. Under **All metrics**, choose the **VPN** metric namespace\.

1. Select the metric dimension to view the metrics \(for example, for the VPN connection\)\.

**To view metrics using the AWS CLI**
+ At a command prompt, use the following command:

  ```
  1. aws cloudwatch list-metrics --namespace "AWS/VPN"
  ```

The following metrics are available from Amazon VPC VPN\.


| Metric | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
|  TunnelState  |  The state of the tunnel\. 0 indicates DOWN and 1 indicates UP\. Units: Boolean  | 
|  TunnelDataIn  |  The bytes received through the VPN tunnel\. Each metric data point represents the number of bytes received after the previous data point\. Use the Sum statistic to show the total number of bytes received during the period\. This metric counts the data after decryption\. Units: Bytes  | 
|  TunnelDataOut  |  The bytes sent through the VPN tunnel\. Each metric data point represents the number of bytes sent after the previous data point\. Use the Sum statistic to show the total number of bytes sent during the period\. This metric counts the data before encryption\. Units: Bytes  | 

You can filter the Amazon VPC VPN data using the following dimensions\.


| Dimension | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| `VpnId` |  This dimension filters the data by the VPN connection\.  | 
| `TunnelIpAddress` |  This dimension filters the data by the IP address of the tunnel for the virtual private gateway\.  | 

## Creating CloudWatch Alarms to Monitor VPN Tunnels<a name="creating-alarms-vpn"></a>

You can create a CloudWatch alarm that sends an Amazon SNS message when the alarm changes state\. An alarm watches a single metric over a time period you specify, and sends a notification to an Amazon SNS topic based on the value of the metric relative to a given threshold over a number of time periods\. 

**Important**
Please kindly note that VPN CloudWatch metrics will not be supported for our legacy VPN version (VPN connections using Virtual Private Gateways (VGWs) created prior to Oct 28, 2015, are running on our legacy VPN version.)\.



For example, you can create an alarm that monitors the state of a VPN tunnel and sends a notification when the tunnel state is DOWN for 3 consecutive 5\-minute periods\.

**To create an alarm for tunnel state**

1. Open the CloudWatch console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Alarms**, **Create Alarm**\.

1. Choose **VPN Tunnel Metrics**\.

1. Choose the IP address of the VPN tunnel and the **TunnelState** metric\. Choose **Next**\.

1. Configure the alarm as follows, and choose **Create Alarm** when you are done:
   + Under **Alarm Threshold**, enter a name and description for your alarm\. For **Whenever**, choose **<=** and enter `0`\. Enter **3** for the consecutive periods\.
   + Under **Actions**, select an existing notification list or choose **New list** to create a new one\. 
   + Under **Alarm Preview**, select a period of 5 minutes and specify a statistic of **Maximum**\.

You can create an alarm that monitors the state of the VPN connection\. For example, the following alarm sends a notification when the status of both tunnels is DOWN for 1 consecutive 5\-minute period\.

**To create an alarm for VPN connection state**

1. Open the CloudWatch console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Alarms**, **Create Alarm**\.

1. Choose **VPN Connection Metrics**\.

1. Select your VPN connection and the **TunnelState** metric\. Choose **Next**\.

1. Configure the alarm as follows, and choose **Create Alarm** when you are done:
   + Under **Alarm Threshold**, enter a name and description for your alarm\. For **Whenever**, choose **<=** and enter `0`\. Enter **1** for the consecutive periods\.
   + Under **Actions**, select an existing notification list or choose **New list** to create a new one\. 
   + Under **Alarm Preview**, select a period of 5 minutes and specify a statistic of **Maximum**\.

     Alternatively, if you've configured your VPN connection so that both tunnels are up, you can specify a statistic of **Minimum** to send a notification when at least one tunnel is down\.

You can also create alarms that monitor the amount of traffic coming in or leaving the VPN tunnel\. For example, the following alarm monitors the amount of traffic coming into the VPN tunnel from your network, and sends a notification when the number of bytes reaches a threshold of 5,000,000 during a 15 minute period\.

**To create an alarm for incoming network traffic**

1. Open the CloudWatch console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Alarms**, **Create Alarm**\.

1. Choose **VPN Tunnel Metrics**\.

1. Select the IP address of the VPN tunnel and the **TunnelDataIn** metric\. Choose **Next**\.

1. Configure the alarm as follows, and choose **Create Alarm** when you are done:
   + Under **Alarm Threshold**, enter a name and description for your alarm\. For **Whenever**, choose **>=** and enter `5000000`\. Enter **1** for the consecutive periods\.
   + Under **Actions**, select an existing notification list or choose **New list** to create a new one\. 
   + Under **Alarm Preview**, select a period of 15 minutes and specify a statistic of **Sum**\.

The following alarm monitors the amount of traffic leaving the VPN tunnel to your network, and sends a notification when the number of bytes is less than 1,000,000 during a 15 minute period\.

**To create an alarm for outgoing network traffic**

1. Open the CloudWatch console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Alarms**, **Create Alarm**\.

1. Choose **VPN Tunnel Metrics**\.

1. Select the IP address of the VPN tunnel and the **TunnelDataOut** metric\. Choose **Next**\.

1. Configure the alarm as follows, and choose **Create Alarm** when you are done:
   + Under **Alarm Threshold**, enter a name and description for your alarm\. For **Whenever**, choose **<=** and enter `1000000`\. Enter **1** for the consecutive periods\.
   + Under **Actions**, select an existing notification list or choose **New list** to create a new one\. 
   + Under **Alarm Preview**, select a period of 15 minutes and specify a statistic of **Sum**\.
