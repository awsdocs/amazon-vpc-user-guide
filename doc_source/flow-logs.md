# VPC Flow Logs<a name="flow-logs"></a>

VPC Flow Logs is a feature that enables you to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC\. Flow log data is stored using Amazon CloudWatch Logs\. After you've created a flow log, you can view and retrieve its data in Amazon CloudWatch Logs\.

Flow logs can help you with a number of tasks; for example, to troubleshoot why specific traffic is not reaching an instance, which in turn helps you diagnose overly restrictive security group rules\. You can also use flow logs as a security tool to monitor the traffic that is reaching your instance\. 

There is no additional charge for using flow logs; however, standard CloudWatch Logs charges apply\. For more information, see [Amazon CloudWatch Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing)\.

## Flow Logs Basics<a name="flow-logs-basics"></a>

You can create a flow log for a VPC, a subnet, or a network interface\. If you create a flow log for a subnet or VPC, each network interface in the VPC or subnet is monitored\. Flow log data is published to a log group in CloudWatch Logs, and each network interface has a unique log stream\. Log streams contain *flow log records*, which are log events consisting of fields that describe the traffic for that network interface\. For more information, see [Flow Log Records](#flow-log-records)\. 

To create a flow log, you specify the resource for which to create the flow log, the type of traffic to capture \(accepted traffic, rejected traffic, or all traffic\), the name of a log group in CloudWatch Logs to which the flow log is published, and the ARN of an IAM role that has sufficient permissions to publish the flow log to the CloudWatch Logs log group\. If you specify the name of a log group that does not exist, we attempt to create the log group for you\. After you've created a flow log, it can take several minutes to begin collecting data and publishing to CloudWatch Logs\. Flow logs do not capture real\-time log streams for your network interfaces\.

You can create multiple flow logs that publish data to the same log group in CloudWatch Logs\. If the same network interface is present in one or more flow logs in the same log group, it has one combined log stream\. If you've specified that one flow log should capture rejected traffic, and the other flow log should capture accepted traffic, then the combined log stream captures all traffic\.

If you launch more instances into your subnet after you've created a flow log for your subnet or VPC, then a new log stream is created for each new network interface as soon as any network traffic is recorded for that network interface\.

You can create flow logs for network interfaces that are created by other AWS services; for example, Elastic Load Balancing, Amazon RDS, Amazon ElastiCache, Amazon Redshift, and Amazon WorkSpaces\. However, you cannot use these services' consoles or APIs to create the flow logs; you must use the Amazon EC2 console or the Amazon EC2 API\. Similarly, you cannot use the CloudWatch Logs console or API to create log streams for your network interfaces\.

If you no longer require a flow log, you can delete it\. Deleting a flow log disables the flow log service for the resource, and no new flow log records or log streams are created\. It does not delete any existing flow log records or log streams for a network interface\. To delete an existing log stream, you can use the CloudWatch Logs console\. After you've deleted a flow log, it can take several minutes to stop collecting data\.

## Flow Log Limitations<a name="flow-logs-limitations"></a>

To use flow logs, you need to be aware of the following limitations:
+ You cannot enable flow logs for network interfaces that are in the EC2\-Classic platform\. This includes EC2\-Classic instances that have been linked to a VPC through ClassicLink\. 
+ You cannot enable flow logs for VPCs that are peered with your VPC unless the peer VPC is in your account\.
+ You cannot tag a flow log\.
+ After you've created a flow log, you cannot change its configuration; for example, you can't associate a different IAM role with the flow log\. Instead, you can delete the flow log and create a new one with the required configuration\. 
+ None of the flow log API actions \(`ec2:*FlowLogs`\) support resource\-level permissions\. To create an IAM policy to control the use of the flow log API actions, you must grant users permissions to use all resources for the action by using the \* wildcard for the resource element in your statement\. For more information, see [Controlling Access to Amazon VPC Resources](VPC_IAM.md)\.
+ If your network interface has multiple IPv4 addresses and traffic is sent to a secondary private IPv4 address, the flow log displays the primary private IPv4 address in the destination IP address field\.

Flow logs do not capture all IP traffic\. The following types of traffic are not logged:
+ Traffic generated by instances when they contact the Amazon DNS server\. If you use your own DNS server, then all traffic to that DNS server is logged\. 
+ Traffic generated by a Windows instance for Amazon Windows license activation\.
+ Traffic to and from `169.254.169.254` for instance metadata\.
+ Traffic to and from `169.254.169.123` for the Amazon Time Sync Service\.
+ DHCP traffic\.
+ Traffic to the reserved IP address for the default VPC router\. For more information, see [VPC and Subnet Sizing](VPC_Subnets.md#VPC_Sizing)\.
+ Traffic between an endpoint network interface and a Network Load Balancer network interface\. For more information, see [VPC Endpoint Services \(AWS PrivateLink\)](endpoint-service.md)\.
+ Traffic to and from an endpoint network interface which has been denied (REJECT) by a Network ACL or Security Group.

## Flow Log Records<a name="flow-log-records"></a>

A flow log record represents a network flow in your flow log\. Each record captures the network flow for a specific 5\-tuple, for a specific capture window\. A 5\-tuple is a set of five different values that specify the source, destination, and protocol for an internet protocol \(IP\) flow\. The capture window is a duration of time during which the flow logs service aggregates data before publishing flow log records\. The capture window is approximately 10 minutes, but can take up to 15 minutes\. A flow log record is a space\-separated string that has the following format:

*version account\-id interface\-id srcaddr dstaddr srcport dstport protocol packets bytes start end action log\-status*


****  

| Field | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| version | The VPC Flow Logs version\. | 
| account\-id | The AWS account ID for the flow log\. | 
| interface\-id | The ID of the network interface for which the log stream applies\. | 
| srcaddr | The source IPv4 or IPv6 address\. The IPv4 address of the network interface is always its private IPv4 address\. | 
| dstaddr | The destination IPv4 or IPv6 address\. The IPv4 address of the network interface is always its private IPv4 address\. | 
| srcport | The source port of the traffic\. | 
| dstport | The destination port of the traffic\. | 
| protocol | The IANA protocol number of the traffic\. For more information, go to [Assigned Internet Protocol Numbers](http://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml)\. | 
| packets | The number of packets transferred during the capture window\. | 
| bytes | The number of bytes transferred during the capture window\. | 
| start | The time, in Unix seconds, of the start of the capture window\. | 
| end | The time, in Unix seconds, of the end of the capture window\. | 
| action | The action associated with the traffic:[\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/flow-logs.html) | 
| log\-status | The logging status of the flow log:[\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/flow-logs.html) | 

If a field is not applicable for a specific record, the record displays a '\-' symbol for that entry\.

For examples of flow log records, see [Examples: Flow Log Records](#flow-logs-records-examples)\.

You can work with flow log records as you would with any other log events collected by CloudWatch Logs\. For more information about monitoring log data and metric filters, see [Searching and Filtering Log Data](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/MonitoringLogData.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\. For an example of setting up a metric filter and alarm for a flow log, see [Example: Creating a CloudWatch Metric Filter and Alarm for a Flow Log](#flow-logs-cw-alarm-example)\. 

You can export log data to Amazon S3 and use Amazon Athena, an interactive query service, to analyze the data\. For more information, see [Querying Amazon VPC Flow Logs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/vpc-flow-logs.html) in the *Amazon Athena User Guide*\.

## IAM Roles for Flow Logs<a name="flow-logs-iam"></a>

The IAM role that's associated with your flow log must have sufficient permissions to publish flow logs to the specified log group in CloudWatch Logs\. The IAM policy that's attached to your IAM role must include at least the following permissions:

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
        "logs:CreateLogGroup",
        "logs:CreateLogStream",
        "logs:PutLogEvents",
        "logs:DescribeLogGroups",
        "logs:DescribeLogStreams"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

You must also ensure that your role has a trust relationship that allows the flow logs service to assume the role:

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "vpc-flow-logs.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```

You can update an existing role or use the following procedure to create a new role for use with flow logs\.

### Creating a Flow Logs Role<a name="create-flow-logs-role"></a>

**To create an IAM role for flow logs**

1. Open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Roles**\.

1. Choose **Create role**\.

1. Choose **EC2** as the service that will use this role and then **EC2** as the use case\. Choose **Next: Permissions**\.

1. On the **Attach permissions policies** page, choose **Next: Review**\.

1. Type a name for your role \(for example, `Flow-Logs-Role`\) and optionally provide a description\. Choose **Create role**\.

1. Select the name of your role\. For **Permissions**, choose **Add inline policy** and choose the **JSON** tab\.

1. Copy the first policy from [IAM Roles for Flow Logs](#flow-logs-iam) and paste it in the window\. Choose **Review policy**\.

1. Type a name for your policy, and then choose **Create policy**\.

1. Select the name of your role\. For **Trust relationships**, choose **Edit trust relationship**\. In the existing policy document, change the service from `ec2.amazonaws.com` to `vpc-flow-logs.amazonaws.com`\. Choose **Update Trust Policy**\.

1. On the **Summary** page, note the ARN for your role\. You need this ARN when you create your flow log\.

## Controlling the Use of Flow Logs<a name="controlling-use-of-flow-logs"></a>

By default, IAM users do not have permission to work with flow logs\. You can create an IAM user policy that grants users the permissions to create, describe, and delete flow logs\. To create a flow log, users must have permissions to use the `iam:PassRole` action for the IAM role that's associated with the flow log\.

The following is an example policy that grants users full permissions to create, describe, and delete flow logs, and view flow log records in CloudWatch Logs\.

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:DeleteFlowLogs",
                "ec2:CreateFlowLogs",
                "ec2:DescribeFlowLogs",
                "logs:GetLogEvents"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
           },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iam:PassRole"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::account:role/flow-log-role-name"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Troubleshooting<a name="flow-logs-troubleshooting"></a>

### Incomplete Flow Log Records<a name="flow-logs-troubleshooting-incomplete-records"></a>

If your flow log records are incomplete, or are no longer being published, there may be a problem delivering the flow logs to the CloudWatch Logs log group\. In either the Amazon EC2 console or the Amazon VPC console, go to the **Flow Logs** tab for the relevant resource\. For more information, see [Viewing Flow Logs](#view-flow-logs)\. The flow logs table displays any errors in the **Status** column\. Alternatively, use the [describe\-flow\-logs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-flow-logs.html) command, and check the value that's returned in the `DeliverLogsErrorMessage` field\. One of the following errors may be displayed:
+ `Rate limited`: This error can occur if CloudWatch logs throttling has been applied — when the number of flow log records for a network interface is higher than the maximum number of records that can be published within a specific timeframe\. This error can also occur if you've reached the limit on the number of CloudWatch Logs log groups that you can create\. For more information, see [CloudWatch Limits](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/cloudwatch_limits.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.
+ `Access error`: The IAM role for your flow log does not have sufficient permissions to publish flow log records to the CloudWatch log group\. For more information, see [IAM Roles for Flow Logs](#flow-logs-iam)\.
+ `Unknown error`: An internal error has occurred in the flow logs service\. 

### Flow Log is Active, But No Flow Log Records or Log Group<a name="flow-logs-troubleshooting-no-log-group"></a>

You've created a flow log, and the Amazon VPC or Amazon EC2 console displays the flow log as `Active`\. However, you cannot see any log streams in CloudWatch Logs, or your CloudWatch Logs log group has not been created\. The cause may be one of the following:
+ The flow log is still in the process of being created\. In some cases, it can take tens of minutes after you've created the flow log for the log group to be created, and for data to be displayed\.
+ There has been no traffic recorded for your network interfaces yet\. The log group in CloudWatch Logs is only created when traffic is recorded\.

## API and CLI Overview<a name="flow-logs-api-cli"></a>

You can perform the tasks described on this page using the command line or API\. For more information about the command line interfaces and a list of available API actions, see [Accessing Amazon VPC](VPC_Introduction.md#VPCInterfaces)\.

## Examples: Flow Log Records<a name="flow-logs-records-examples"></a>

**Flow Log Records for Accepted and Rejected Traffic**

The following is an example of a flow log record in which SSH traffic \(destination port 22, TCP protocol\) to network interface `eni-abc123de` in account `123456789010` was allowed\.

```
2 123456789010 eni-abc123de 172.31.16.139 172.31.16.21 20641 22 6 20 4249 1418530010 1418530070 ACCEPT OK
```

The following is an example of a flow log record in which RDP traffic \(destination port 3389, TCP protocol\) to network interface `eni-abc123de` in account `123456789010` was rejected\.

```
2 123456789010 eni-abc123de 172.31.9.69 172.31.9.12 49761 3389 6 20 4249 1418530010 1418530070 REJECT OK
```

**Flow Log Records for No Data and Skipped Records**

The following is an example of a flow log record in which no data was recorded during the capture window\.

```
2 123456789010 eni-1a2b3c4d - - - - - - - 1431280876 1431280934 - NODATA
```

The following is an example of a flow log record in which records were skipped during the capture window\.

```
2 123456789010 eni-4b118871 - - - - - - - 1431280876 1431280934 - SKIPDATA
```

**Security Group and Network ACL Rules**

If you're using flow logs to diagnose overly restrictive or permissive security group rules or network ACL rules, then be aware of the statefulness of these resources\. Security groups are stateful — this means that responses to allowed traffic are also allowed, even if the rules in your security group do not permit it\. Conversely, network ACLs are stateless, therefore responses to allowed traffic are subject to network ACL rules\.

For example, you use the `ping` command from your home computer \(IP address is `203.0.113.12`\) to your instance \(the network interface's private IP address is `172.31.16.139`\)\. Your security group's inbound rules allow ICMP traffic and the outbound rules do not allow ICMP traffic; however, because security groups are stateful, the response ping from your instance is allowed\. Your network ACL permits inbound ICMP traffic but does not permit outbound ICMP traffic\. Because network ACLs are stateless, the response ping is dropped and will not reach your home computer\. In a flow log, this is displayed as 2 flow log records: 
+ An `ACCEPT` record for the originating ping that was allowed by both the network ACL and the security group, and therefore was allowed to reach your instance\. 
+ A `REJECT` record for the response ping that the network ACL denied\.

```
2 123456789010 eni-1235b8ca 203.0.113.12 172.31.16.139 0 0 1 4 336 1432917027 1432917142 ACCEPT OK
```

```
2 123456789010 eni-1235b8ca 172.31.16.139 203.0.113.12 0 0 1 4 336 1432917094 1432917142 REJECT OK
```

If your network ACL permits outbound ICMP traffic, the flow log displays two `ACCEPT` records \(one for the originating ping and one for the response ping\)\. If your security group denies inbound ICMP traffic, the flow log displays a single `REJECT` record, because the traffic was not permitted to reach your instance\.

**Flow Log Record for IPv6 Traffic**

The following is an example of a flow log record in which SSH traffic \(port 22\) from IPv6 address `2001:db8:1234:a100:8d6e:3477:df66:f105` to network interface `eni-f41c42bf` in account `123456789010` was allowed\.

```
2 123456789010 eni-f41c42bf 2001:db8:1234:a100:8d6e:3477:df66:f105 2001:db8:1234:a102:3304:8879:34cf:4071 34892 22 6 54 8855 1477913708 1477913820 ACCEPT OK
```

## Example: Creating a CloudWatch Metric Filter and Alarm for a Flow Log<a name="flow-logs-cw-alarm-example"></a>

In this example, you have a flow log for `eni-1a2b3c4d`\. You want to create an alarm that alerts you if there have been 10 or more rejected attempts to connect to your instance over TCP port 22 \(SSH\) within a 1 hour time period\. First, you must create a metric filter that matches the pattern of the traffic for which you want to create the alarm\. Then, you can create an alarm for the metric filter\.

**To create a metric filter for rejected SSH traffic and create an alarm for the filter**

1. Open the CloudWatch console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Logs**, select the flow log group for your flow log, and then choose **Create Metric Filter**\.

1. In the **Filter Pattern** field, enter the following:

   ```
   [version, account, eni, source, destination, srcport, destport="22", protocol="6", packets, bytes, windowstart, windowend, action="REJECT", flowlogstatus]
