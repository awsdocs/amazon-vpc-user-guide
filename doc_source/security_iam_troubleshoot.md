## I am not authorized to perform an action in Amazon VPC<a name="security_iam_troubleshoot-no-permissions"></a>

If the AWS Management Console tells you that you're not authorized to perform an action, then you must contact your administrator for assistance\. Your administrator is the person that provided you with your sign\-in credentials\.

The following example error occurs when the `mateojackson` IAM user tries to use the console to view details about a subnet but belongs to an IAM role that does not have `ec2:DescribeSubnets` permissions\.

```
User: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/mateojackson is not authorized to perform: ec2:DescribeSubnets on resource: subnet-id
```

In this case, Mateo asks his administrator to update the policy to allow him to access the subnet\.

## I am not authorized to perform iam:PassRole<a name="security_iam_troubleshoot-passrole"></a>

If you receive an error that you're not authorized to perform the `iam:PassRole` action, your policies must be updated to allow you to pass a role to Amazon VPC\.

Some AWS services allow you to pass an existing role to that service instead of creating a new service role or service\-linked role\. To do this, you must have permissions to pass the role to the service\.

The following example error occurs when an IAM user named `marymajor` tries to use the console to perform an action in Amazon VPC\. However, the action requires the service to have permissions that are granted by a service role\. Mary does not have permissions to pass the role to the service\.

```
User: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/marymajor is not authorized to perform: iam:PassRole
```

In this case, Mary's policies must be updated to allow her to perform the `iam:PassRole` action\.

If you need help, contact your AWS administrator\. Your administrator is the person who provided you with your sign\-in credentials\.

## I want to allow people outside of my AWS account to access my Amazon VPC resources<a name="security_iam_troubleshoot-cross-account-access"></a>

You can create a role that users in other accounts or people outside of your organization can use to access your resources\. You can specify who is trusted to assume the role\. For services that support resource\-based policies or access control lists \(ACLs\), you can use those policies to grant people access to your resources\.
