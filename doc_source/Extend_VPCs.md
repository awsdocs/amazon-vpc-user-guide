# Extending Your VPCs<a name="Extend_VPCs"></a>

You can host VPC resources such as subnets, in multiple locations world\-wide\. These locations are composed of Regions, Availability Zones, Local Zones, and Wavelength Zones\. Each *Region* is a separate geographic area\. 
+ Availability Zones are multiple, isolated locations within each Region\.
+ Local Zones provide you the ability to place resources, such as compute and storage, in multiple locations closer to your end users\.
+ AWS Outposts brings native AWS services, infrastructure, and operating models to virtually any data center, co\-location space, or on\-premises facility\.
+ Wavelength Zones allow developers to build applications that deliver ultra\-low latencies to 5G devices and end users\. Wavelength deploys standard AWS compute and storage services to the edge of telecommunication carriers' 5G networks\.

AWS operates state\-of\-the\-art, highly available data centers\. Although rare, failures can occur that affect the availability of instances that are in the same location\. If you host all of your instances in a single location that is affected by a failure, none of your instances would be available\.

To help you determine which deployment is best for you, see [AWS Wavelength FAQs](http://aws.amazon.com/wavelength/faqs/)\.

## Extending your VPC resources to Local Zones<a name="local-zone"></a>

AWS Local Zones allow you to seamlessly connect to the full range of services in the AWS Region such as Amazon Simple Storage Service and Amazon DynamoDB through the same APIs and tool sets\. You can extend your VPC Region by creating a new subnet that has a Local Zone assignment\. When you create a subnet in a Local Zone, the VPC is also extended to that Local Zone\. 

To use a Local Zone, you must first opt in to the Zone\. Next, create a subnet in the Local Zone\. Finally, launch any of the following resources in the Local Zone subnet, so that your applications are closer to your end users:
+ Amazon EC2 instances
+ Amazon EBS volumes
+ Amazon FSx file servers
+ Application Load Balancer
+ Dedicated Hosts

A network border group is a unique set of Availability Zones or Local Zones from where AWS advertises public IP addresses\.

When you create a VPC that has IPv6 addresses, you can choose to assign a set of Amazon\-provided public IP addresses to the VPC and also set a network border group for the addresses that limits the addresses to the group\. When you set a network border group, the IP addresses cannot move between network border groups\. The `us-west-2` network border group contains the four US West \(Oregon\) Availability Zones\. The `us-west-2-lax-1` network border group contains the Los Angeles Local Zones\.

The following rules apply to Local Zones:
+ The Local Zone subnets follow the same routing rules as Availability Zone subnet, including route tables, security groups, and network ACLs\.
+ You can assign Local Zones to subnets using the Amazon VPC Console, AWS CLI or API\.
+ You must provision public IP addresses for use in a Local Zone\. When you allocate addresses, you can specify the location from which the IP address is advertised\. We refer to this as a network border group and you can set this parameter to limit the address to this location\. After you provision the IP addresses, you cannot move them between the Local Zone and the parent Region \(for example, from u`s-west-2-lax-1a` to `us-west-2`\)\. 
+ You can request the IPv6 Amazon\-provided IP addresses and associate them with the network border group for a new or existing VPC\. 

### Accessing Local Zones using a Direct Connect gateway<a name="access-local-zone"></a>

Consider the scenario where you want an on\-premises data center to access resources that are in a Local Zone\. You use a virtual private gateway for the VPC associated with the Local Zone to connect to a Direct Connect gateway\. The Direct Connect gateway connects to an AWS Direct Connect location in a Region\. The on\-premises data center has an AWS Direct Connect connection to the AWS Direct Connect location\.

![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/images/dxgw-lz.png)

You configure the following resources for this configuration:
+ A virtual private gateway for the VPC that is associated with the Local Zone subnet\. You can view the VPC for the subnet on the subnet details page in the Amazon VPC Console, or use [describe\-subnets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-subnets.html)\.

  For information about how to create a virtual private gateway, see [Create a target gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/SetUpVPNConnections.html#vpn-create-target-gateway) in the *AWS Site\-to\-Site VPN User Guide*\.
+ A Direct Connect connection\. AWS recommends that you use one of the following locations for the best latency performance to the LA Local Zones:
  + T5 at El Segundo, Los Angeles, CA \(AWS recommends this location for the lowest latency to the LA Local Zone\)
  + CoreSite LA1, Los Angeles, CA
  + Equinix LA3, El Segundo, CA

  For information about how to order a connection, see [Cross connects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/Colocation.html#cross-connect-us-west-1) in the *AWS Direct Connect User Guide*\.
+ A Direct Connect gateway\. For information about how to create a Direct Connect gateway, see [Create a Direct Connect gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/direct-connect-gateways-intro.html#create-direct-connect-gateway) in the *AWS Direct Connect User Guide*\.
+ A virtual private gateway association to connect the VPC to the Direct Connect gateway\. For information about how to create a virtual private gateway association, see [Associating and disassociating virtual private gateways](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/virtualgateways.html#associate-vgw-with-direct-connect-gateway) in the *AWS Direct Connect User Guide*\.
+ A private virtual interface on the connection from the AWS Direct Connect location to the on\-premises data center\. 
+ For information about how to create a Direct Connect gateway, see [Creating a private virtual interface to the Direct Connect gateway ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/virtualgateways.html#create-private-vif-for-gateway) in the *AWS Direct Connect User Guide*\.

### Connecting Local Zone subnets to a transit gateway<a name="connect-local-zone-tgw"></a>

The following diagram shows how to configure your network so that subnets in the Local Zone connect to a transit gateway\. You have a subnet in the Local Zone \(subnet 3\) and a subnet in the parent Availability Zone \(subnet 2\)\. You connect subnet 2 to the transit gateway, and then create a route in the VPC 2 route table that routes traffic for the VPC 1 CIDR to the transit gateway\.

![\[Local Zone to transit gateway\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/images/lz-tgw.png)

You need to create the following resources to enable communication:
+ A subnet in the parent Availability Zone\. For information about creating subnets, see [Creating a subnet in your VPC](working-with-vpcs.md#AddaSubnet)\. Use [describe\-availability\-zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-availability-zones.html) to find the parent zone\.
+ A transit gateway\. For information about how to create a transit gateway, see [Create a transit gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/tgw-transit-gateways.html#create-tgw) in the *AWS Transit Gateways Guide*\.
+ A VPC attachment for the Availability Zone VPC to the transit gateway\. For information about how to create a transit gateway attachment to a VPC, see [Transit gateway attachments to a VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/tgw-vpc-attachments.html) in the *AWS Transit Gateways Guide*\.
+ An entry for the Availability Zone VPC in the transit gateway route table\. For information about how to create transit gateway routes, see [Transit gateway route tables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/tgw-route-tables.html) in the *AWS Transit Gateways Guide*\.
+ For each VPC, an entry in the VPC route table that has the other VPC CIDR as the destination, and the transit gateway ID as the target\. For more information, see [Routing for a transit gateway](route-table-options.md#route-tables-tgw)\.

  In the example, the route table for VPC 1 contains the following entry:    
[\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/Extend_VPCs.html)

  The route table for VPC 2 has the following entry:     
[\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/Extend_VPCs.html)

## Extending your VPC resources to Wavelength Zones<a name="subnet-wavelength"></a>

*AWS Wavelength* allows developers to build applications that deliver ultra\-low latencies to mobile devices and end\-users\. Wavelength deploys standard AWS compute and storage services to the edge of telecommunication carriers' 5G networks\. Developers can extend a Amazon Virtual Private Cloud \(VPC\) to one or more Wavelength Zones, and then use AWS resources like Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(EC2\) instances to run applications that require ultra\-low latency and connect to AWS services in the Region\. 

To use a Wavelength Zones, you must first opt in to the Zone\. Next, create a subnet in the Wavelength Zone\. You can create Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon EBS volumes, and Amazon VPC subnets and carrier gateways in Wavelength Zones\. You can also use services that orchestrate or work with EC2, EBS and VPC such as Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, Amazon EKS clusters, Amazon ECS clusters, Amazon EC2 Systems Manager, Amazon CloudWatch, AWS CloudTrail, and AWS CloudFormation\. The services in Wavelength are part of a VPC that is connected over a reliable, high bandwidth connection to an AWS Region for easy access to services including Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon RDS\.

The following rules apply to Wavelength Zones:
+ A VPC extends to a Wavelength Zone when you create a subnet in the VPC and associate it with the Wavelength Zone\.
+ By default, every subnet that you create in a VPC that spans a Wavelength Zone inherits the main VPC route table, including the local route\. 
+ When you launch an EC2 instance in a subnet in a Wavelength Zone, you assign a carrier IP address to it\. The carrier gateway uses the address for traffic from the interface to the internet, or mobile devices\. The carrier gateway uses NAT to translate the address, and then sends the traffic to the destination\. Traffic from the telecommunication carrier network routes through the carrier gateway\.
+ You can set the target of a VPC route table, or subnet route table in a Wavelength Zone to a carrier gateway, which allows inbound traffic from a carrier network in a specific location, and outbound traffic to the carrier network and internet\. For more information about routing options in a Wavelength Zone, see [Routing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wavelength/latest/developerguide/how-wavelengths-work.html#wavelength-routing-overview) in the *AWS Wavelength Developer Guide*\.
+ You can assign Wavelength Zones to subnets using the Amazon VPC Console, AWS CLI or API\.
+ Subnets in Wavelength Zones have the same networking components as subnets in Availability Zones, including IPv4 addresses, DHCP Option sets, and network ACLs\. 

### Multiple Wavelength Zone considerations<a name="multiple-wavelength-zones"></a>

**Note**  
EC2 instances that are in two different Wavelength Zones in the same VPC are not allowed to communicate with each other\. If you need Wavelength Zone to Wavelength Zone communication, AWS recommends that you use multiple VPCs, one for each Wavelength Zone\. You can use a transit gateway to connect the VPCs\. This configuration enables communication between instances in the Wavelength Zones\.  
Wavelength Zone to Wavelength Zone traffic routes through the AWS region\. For more information, see [AWS Transit Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/transit-gateway/)\.

The following diagram shows how to configure your network so that instances in two different Wavelength Zones can communicate\. You have two Wavelength Zones \(Wavelength Zone A and Wavelength Zone B\)\. You need to create the following resources to enable communication:
+ For each Wavelength Zone, a subnet in an Availability Zone that is the parent Availability Zone for the Wavelength Zone\. In the example, you create subnet 1 and subnet 2\. For information about creating subnets, see [Creating a subnet in your VPC](working-with-vpcs.md#AddaSubnet)\. Use [describe\-availability\-zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-availability-zones.html) to find the parent zone\.
+ A transit gateway\. The transit gateway connects the VPCs\. For information about how to create a transit gateway, see [Create a transit gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/tgw-transit-gateways.html#create-tgw) in the *AWS Transit Gateways Guide*\.
+ For each VPC, a VPC attachment to the transit gateway\. For information about how to create a transit gateway attachment to a VPC, see [Transit gateway attachments to a VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/tgw-vpc-attachments.html) in the *AWS Transit Gateways Guide*\.
+ Entries for each VPC in the transit gateway route table\. For information about how to create transit gateway routes, see [Transit gateway route tables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/tgw-route-tables.html) in the *AWS Transit Gateways Guide*\.
+ For each VPC, an entry in the VPC route table that has the other VPC CIDR as the destination, and the transit gateway ID as the target\. For more information, see [Routing for a transit gateway](route-table-options.md#route-tables-tgw)\.

  In the example, the route table for VPC 1 has the following entry:     
[\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/Extend_VPCs.html)

  The route table for VPC 2 has the following entry:     
[\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/Extend_VPCs.html)

## Subnets in AWS Outposts<a name="outposts"></a>

AWS Outposts offers you the same AWS hardware infrastructure, services, APIs, and tools to build and run your applications on premises and in the cloud\. AWS Outposts is ideal for workloads that need low latency access to on\-premises applications or systems, and for workloads that need to store and process data locally\. For more information about AWS Outposts, see [AWS Outposts](https://aws.amazon.com/outposts)\. 

Amazon VPC spans across all of the Availability Zones in an AWS Region\. When you connect Outposts to the parent Region, all existing and newly created VPCs in your account span across all Availability Zones and any associated Outpost locations in the Region\.

The following rules apply to AWS Outposts:
+ The subnets must reside in one Outpost location\.
+ A local gateway handles the network connectivity between your VPC and on\-premises networks\. For information about local gateways, see [Local Gateways](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/outposts/latest/userguide/outposts-local-gateways.html) in the *AWS Outposts User Guide*\.
+ If your account is associated with AWS Outposts, you assign the subnet to an Outpost by specifying the Outpost ARN when you create the subnet\. 
+ By default, every subnet that you create in a VPC associated with an Outpost inherits the main VPC route table, including the local gateway route\. You can also explicitly associate a custom route table with the subnets in your VPC and have a local gateway as a next\-hop target for all traffic that needs to be routed to the on\-premises network\.
