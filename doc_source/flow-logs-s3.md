# Publishing flow logs to Amazon S3<a name="flow-logs-s3"></a>

Flow logs can publish flow log data to Amazon S3\.

When publishing to Amazon S3, flow log data is published to an existing Amazon S3 bucket that you specify\. Flow log records for all of the monitored network interfaces are published to a series of log file objects that are stored in the bucket\. If the flow log captures data for a VPC, the flow log publishes flow log records for all of the network interfaces in the selected VPC\. For more information, see [Flow log records](flow-logs.md#flow-log-records)\.

To create an Amazon S3 bucket for use with flow logs, see [Create a Bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html) in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Getting Started Guide*\.

## Flow log files<a name="flow-logs-s3-path"></a>

Flow logs collect flow log records, consolidate them into log files, and then publish the log files to the Amazon S3 bucket at 5\-minute intervals\. Each log file contains flow log records for the IP traffic recorded in the previous five minutes\.

The maximum file size for a log file is 75 MB\. If the log file reaches the file size limit within the 5\-minute period, the flow log stops adding flow log records to it\. Then it publishes the flow log to the Amazon S3 bucket, and creates a new log file\.

Log files are saved to the specified Amazon S3 bucket using a folder structure that is determined by the flow log's ID, Region, and the date on which they are created\. The bucket folder structure uses the following format\.

```
bucket_ARN/optional_folder/AWSLogs/aws_account_id/vpcflowlogs/region/year/month/day/log_file_name.log.gz
```

Similarly, the log file's file name is determined by the flow log's ID, Region, and the date and time that it was created by the flow logs service\. File names use the following format\. The timestamp uses the `YYYYMMDDTHHmmZ` format\.

```
aws_account_id_vpcflowlogs_region_flow_log_id_timestamp_hash.log.gz
```

For example, the following shows the folder structure and file name of a log file for a flow log created by AWS account `123456789012`, for a resource in the `us-east-1` Region, on `June 20, 2018` at `16:20 UTC`\. It includes flow log records for `16:15:00` to `16:19:59`\. 

```
arn:aws:s3:::my-flow-log-bucket/AWSLogs/123456789012/vpcflowlogs/us-east-1/2018/06/20/123456789012_vpcflowlogs_us-east-1_fl-1234abcd_20180620T1620Z_fe123456.log.gz
```

In Amazon S3, the **Last modified** field for the flow log file indicates the date and time at which the file was uploaded to the Amazon S3 bucket\. This is later than the timestamp in the file name, and differs by the amount of time taken to upload the file to the Amazon S3 bucket\.

## IAM policy for IAM principals that publish flow logs to Amazon S3<a name="flow-logs-s3-iam"></a>

An IAM principal in your account, such as an IAM user, must have sufficient permissions to publish flow logs to the Amazon S3 bucket\. This includes permissions to work with specific `logs:` actions to create and publish the flow logs\. The IAM policy must include the following permissions\.

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "logs:CreateLogDelivery",
        "logs:DeleteLogDelivery"
        ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Amazon S3 bucket permissions for flow logs<a name="flow-logs-s3-permissions"></a>

By default, Amazon S3 buckets and the objects they contain are private\. Only the bucket owner can access the bucket and the objects stored in it\. However, the bucket owner can grant access to other resources and users by writing an access policy\.

The following bucket policy gives the flow log permission to publish logs to it\. If the bucket already has a policy with the following permissions, the policy is kept as is\. We recommend that you grant these permissions to the log delivery service principal instead of individual AWS account ARNs\.

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AWSLogDeliveryWrite",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {"Service": "delivery.logs.amazonaws.com"},
            "Action": "s3:PutObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::bucket_name/optional_folder/AWSLogs/account_id/*",
            "Condition": {"StringEquals": {"s3:x-amz-acl": "bucket-owner-full-control"}}
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AWSLogDeliveryAclCheck",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {"Service": "delivery.logs.amazonaws.com"},
            "Action": "s3:GetBucketAcl",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::bucket_name"
        }
    ]
}
```

If the user creating the flow log owns the bucket, has `PutBucketPolicy` permissions for the bucket, and the bucket does not have a policy with sufficient log delivery permissions, we automatically attach the preceding policy to the bucket\. This policy overwrites any existing policy attached to the bucket\.

If the user creating the flow log does not own the bucket, or does not have the `GetBucketPolicy` and `PutBucketPolicy` permissions for the bucket, the flow log creation fails\. In this case, the bucket owner must manually add the above policy to the bucket and specify the flow log creator's AWS account ID\. For more information, see [How Do I Add an S3 Bucket Policy?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/add-bucket-policy.html) in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Console User Guide*\. If the bucket receives flow logs from multiple accounts, add a `Resource` element entry to the `AWSLogDeliveryWrite` policy statement for each account\. For example, the following bucket policy allows AWS accounts `123123123123` and `456456456456` to publish flow logs to a folder named `flow-logs` in a bucket named `log-bucket`\.

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AWSLogDeliveryWrite",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {"Service": "delivery.logs.amazonaws.com"},
            "Action": "s3:PutObject",
            "Resource": [
            	"arn:aws:s3:::log-bucket/flow-logs/AWSLogs/123123123123/*",
            	"arn:aws:s3:::log-bucket/flow-logs/AWSLogs/456456456456/*"
            	],
            "Condition": {"StringEquals": {"s3:x-amz-acl": "bucket-owner-full-control"}}
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AWSLogDeliveryAclCheck",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {"Service": "delivery.logs.amazonaws.com"},
            "Action": "s3:GetBucketAcl",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::log-bucket"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Required CMK key policy for use with SSE\-KMS<a name="flow-logs-s3-cmk-policy"></a>

You can protect the data in your Amazon S3 bucket by enabling either Server\-Side Encryption with Amazon S3\-Managed Keys \(SSE\-S3\) or Server\-Side Encryption with Customer Master Keys \(CMKs\) Stored in AWS Key Management Service \(SSE\-KMS\)\. For more information, see [Protecting data using server\-side encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/serv-side-encryption.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*\.

With SSE\-KMS, you can use either an AWS managed CMK or a customer managed CMK\. With an AWS managed CMK, you can't use cross\-account delivery\. Flow logs are delivered from the log delivery account, so you must grant access for cross\-account delivery\. To grant cross\-account access to your S3 bucket, use a customer managed CMK and specify the Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of the customer managed CMK when you enable bucket encryption\. For more information, see [Specifying server\-side encryption with AWS KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/specifying-kms-encryption.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*\.

When you use SSE\-KMS with a customer managed CMK, you must add the following to the key policy for your CMK \(not the bucket policy for your S3 bucket\), so that VPC Flow Logs can write to your S3 bucket\.

```
{
    "Sid": "Allow VPC Flow Logs to use the key",
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {
        "Service": [
            "delivery.logs.amazonaws.com"
        ]
    },
   "Action": [
       "kms:Encrypt",
       "kms:Decrypt",
       "kms:ReEncrypt*",
       "kms:GenerateDataKey*",
       "kms:DescribeKey"
    ],
    "Resource": "*"
}
```

## Amazon S3 log file permissions<a name="flow-logs-file-permissions"></a>

In addition to the required bucket policies, Amazon S3 uses access control lists \(ACLs\) to manage access to the log files created by a flow log\. By default, the bucket owner has `FULL_CONTROL` permissions on each log file\. The log delivery owner, if different from the bucket owner, has no permissions\. The log delivery account has `READ` and `WRITE` permissions\. For more information, see [Access Control List \(ACL\) Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html) in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*\.

## Creating a flow log that publishes to Amazon S3<a name="flow-logs-s3-create-flow-log"></a>

After you have created and configured your Amazon S3 bucket, you can create flow logs for your VPCs, subnets, or network interfaces\.

**To create a flow log for a network interface using the console**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Network Interfaces**\.

1. Select one or more network interfaces and choose **Actions**, **Create flow log**\.

1. For **Filter**, specify the type of IP traffic data to log\. Choose **All** to log accepted and rejected traffic, **Rejected** to record only rejected traffic, or **Accepted** to record only accepted traffic\.

1. For **Maximum aggregation interval**, choose the maximum period of time during which a flow is captured and aggregated into one flow log record\.

1. For **Destination**, choose **Send to an Amazon S3 bucket**\.

1. For **S3 bucket ARN**, specify the Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of an existing Amazon S3 bucket\. You can include a subfolder in the bucket ARN\. The bucket cannot use `AWSLogs` as a subfolder name, as this is a reserved term\.

   For example, to specify a subfolder named `my-logs` in a bucket named `my-bucket`, use the following ARN:

   `arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/my-logs/`

   If you own the bucket, we automatically create a resource policy and attach it to the bucket\. For more information, see [Amazon S3 bucket permissions for flow logs](#flow-logs-s3-permissions)\.

1. For **Format**, specify the format for the flow log record\.
   + To use the default flow log record format, choose **AWS default format**\.
   + To create a custom format, choose **Custom format**\. For **Log format**, choose the fields to include in the flow log record\.
**Tip**  
To create a custom flow log that includes the default format fields, first choose **AWS default format**, copy the fields in **Format preview**, then choose **Custom format** and paste the fields in the text box\.

1. \(Optional\) Choose **Add Tag** to apply tags to the flow log\.

1. Choose **Create**\.

**To create a flow log for a VPC or a subnet using the console**

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Your VPCs** or **Subnets**\.

1. Select one or more VPCs or subnets and then choose **Actions**, **Create flow log**\.

1. For **Filter**, specify the type of IP traffic data to log\. Choose **All** to log accepted and rejected traffic, **Rejected** to record only rejected traffic, or **Accepted** to record only accepted traffic\.

1. For **Maximum aggregation interval**, choose the maximum period of time during which a flow is captured and aggregated into one flow log record\.

1. For **Destination**, choose **Send to an Amazon S3 bucket**\.

1. For **S3 bucket ARN**, specify the Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of an existing Amazon S3 bucket\. You can include a subfolder in the bucket ARN\. The bucket cannot use `AWSLogs` as a subfolder name, as this is a reserved term\.

   For example, to specify a subfolder named `my-logs` in a bucket named `my-bucket`, use the following ARN:

   `arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/my-logs/`

   If you own the bucket, we automatically create a resource policy and attach it to the bucket\. For more information, see [Amazon S3 bucket permissions for flow logs](#flow-logs-s3-permissions)\.

1. For **Format**, specify the format for the flow log record\.
   + To use the default flow log record format, choose **AWS default format**\.
   + To create a custom format, choose **Custom format**\. For **Log format**, choose each of the fields to include in the flow log record\.

1. \(Optional\) Choose **Add Tag** to apply tags to the flow log\.

1. Choose **Create**\.

**To create a flow log that publishes to Amazon S3 using a command line tool**  
Use one of the following commands\.
+ [create\-flow\-logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-flow-logs.html) \(AWS CLI\)
+ [New\-EC2FlowLogs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/New-EC2FlowLogs.html) \(AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell\)
+ [CreateFlowLogs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CreateFlowLogs.html) \(Amazon EC2 Query API\)

The following AWS CLI example creates a flow log that captures all traffic for VPC `vpc-00112233344556677` and delivers the flow logs to an Amazon S3 bucket called `flow-log-bucket`\. The `--log-format` parameter specifies a custom format for the flow log records\.

```
aws ec2 create-flow-logs --resource-type VPC --resource-ids vpc-00112233344556677 --traffic-type ALL --log-destination-type s3 --log-destination arn:aws:s3:::flow-log-bucket/my-custom-flow-logs/ --log-format '${version} ${vpc-id} ${subnet-id} ${instance-id} ${srcaddr} ${dstaddr} ${srcport} ${dstport} ${protocol} ${tcp-flags} ${type} ${pkt-srcaddr} ${pkt-dstaddr}'
```

## Processing flow log records in Amazon S3<a name="process-records-s3"></a>

The log files are compressed\. If you open the log files using the Amazon S3 console, they are decompressed and the flow log records are displayed\. If you download the files, you must decompress them to view the flow log records\.

You can also query the flow log records in the log files using Amazon Athena\. Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easier to analyze data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL\. For more information, see [Querying Amazon VPC Flow Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/vpc-flow-logs.html) in the *Amazon Athena User Guide*\.
