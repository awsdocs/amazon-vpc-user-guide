# Publishing flow logs to CloudWatch Logs<a name="flow-logs-cwl"></a>

Flow logs can publish flow log data directly to Amazon CloudWatch\.

When publishing to CloudWatch Logs, flow log data is published to a log group, and each network interface has a unique log stream in the log group\. Log streams contain flow log records\. You can create multiple flow logs that publish data to the same log group\. If the same network interface is present in one or more flow logs in the same log group, it has one combined log stream\. If you've specified that one flow log should capture rejected traffic, and the other flow log should capture accepted traffic, then the combined log stream captures all traffic\. For more information, see [Flow log records](flow-logs.md#flow-log-records)\.

In CloudWatch Logs, the **timestamp** field corresponds to the start time that's captured in the flow log record\. The **ingestionTime** field indicates the date and time when the flow log record was received by CloudWatch Logs\. This timestamp is later than the end time that's captured in the flow log record\.

## IAM roles for publishing flow logs to CloudWatch Logs<a name="flow-logs-iam"></a>

The IAM role that's associated with your flow log must have sufficient permissions to publish flow logs to the specified log group in CloudWatch Logs\. The IAM role must belong to your AWS account\.

The IAM policy that's attached to your IAM role must include at least the following permissions\.

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
        "logs:CreateLogGroup",
        "logs:CreateLogStream",
        "logs:PutLogEvents",
        "logs:DescribeLogGroups",
        "logs:DescribeLogStreams"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

Also ensure that your role has a trust relationship that allows the flow logs service to assume the role\.

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "vpc-flow-logs.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```

You can update an existing role or use the following procedure to create a new role for use with flow logs\.

### Creating a flow logs role<a name="create-flow-logs-role"></a>

**To create an IAM role for flow logs**

1. Open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Roles**, **Create role**\.

1. Choose **EC2** as the service to use this role\. For **Use case**, choose **EC2**\. Choose **Next: Permissions**\.

1. On the **Attach permissions policies** page, choose **Next: Tags** and optionally add tags\. Choose **Next: Review**\.

1. Enter a name for your role \(for example, `Flow-Logs-Role`\) and optionally provide a description\. Choose **Create role**\.

1. Select the name of your role\. For **Permissions**, choose **Add inline policy**, **JSON**\.

1. Copy the first policy from [IAM roles for publishing flow logs to CloudWatch Logs](#flow-logs-iam) and paste it in the window\. Choose **Review policy**\.

1. Enter a name for your policy, and choose **Create policy**\.

1. Select the name of your role\. For **Trust relationships**, choose **Edit trust relationship**\. In the existing policy document, change the service from `ec2.amazonaws.com` to `vpc-flow-logs.amazonaws.com`\. Choose **Update Trust Policy**\.

1. On the **Summary** page, note the ARN for your role\. You need this ARN when you create your flow log\.

## Permissions for IAM users to pass a role<a name="flow-logs-iam-user"></a>

Users must also have permissions to use the `iam:PassRole` action for the IAM role that's associated with the flow log\.

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["iam:PassRole"],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::account-id:role/flow-log-role-name"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Creating a flow log that publishes to CloudWatch Logs<a name="flow-logs-cwl-create-flow-log"></a>

You can create flow logs for your VPCs, subnets, or network interfaces\. If you perform these steps as an IAM user, ensure that you have permissions to use the `iam:PassRole` action\. For more information, see [Permissions for IAM users to pass a role](#flow-logs-iam-user)\.

**Prerequisite**

   + To create a custom flow log that includes the default fields, choose **AWS default format**, copy the fields in **Format preview**, then choose **Custom format** and paste the fields in the text box\.

1. \(Optional\) Choose **Add new tag** to apply tags to the flow log\.

1. Choose **Create flow log**\.

**To create a flow log for a VPC or a subnet using the console**

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

**To create a flow log using the command line**

Use one of the following commands\.
+ [create\-flow\-logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-flow-logs.html) \(AWS CLI\)
+ [New\-EC2FlowLogs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/New-EC2FlowLogs.html) \(AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell\)
+ [CreateFlowLogs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CreateFlowLogs.html) \(Amazon EC2 Query API\)

The following AWS CLI example creates a flow log that captures all accepted traffic for subnet `subnet-1a2b3c4d`\. The flow logs are delivered to a log group in CloudWatch Logs called `my-flow-logs`, in account 123456789101, using the IAM role `publishFlowLogs`\.

```
aws ec2 create-flow-logs --resource-type Subnet --resource-ids subnet-1a2b3c4d --traffic-type ACCEPT --log-group-name my-flow-logs --deliver-logs-permission-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789101:role/publishFlowLogs
```

## Processing flow log records in CloudWatch Logs<a name="process-records-cwl"></a>

You can work with flow log records as you would with any other log events collected by CloudWatch Logs\. For more information about monitoring log data and metric filters, see [Searching and Filtering Log Data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/MonitoringLogData.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.

### Example: Creating a CloudWatch metric filter and alarm for a flow log<a name="flow-logs-cw-alarm-example"></a>

In this example, you have a flow log for `eni-1a2b3c4d`\. You want to create an alarm that alerts you if there have been 10 or more rejected attempts to connect to your instance over TCP port 22 \(SSH\) within a 1\-hour time period\. First, you must create a metric filter that matches the pattern of the traffic for which to create the alarm\. Then, you can create an alarm for the metric filter\.

**To create a metric filter for rejected SSH traffic and create an alarm for the filter**

1. Open the CloudWatch console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Logs**\.

1. Choose the associated **Metric Filters** value for the log group for your flow log, and then choose **Add Metric Filter**\.

1. For **Filter Pattern**, enter the following\.

   ```
   [version, account, eni, source, destination, srcport, destport="22", protocol="6", packets, bytes, windowstart, windowend, action="REJECT", flowlogstatus]
   ```

1. For **Select Log Data to Test**, select the log stream for your network interface\. \(Optional\) To view the lines of log data that match the filter pattern, choose **Test Pattern**\. When you're ready, choose **Assign Metric**\.

1. Provide a metric namespace and name, and ensure that the metric value is set to **1**\. When you're done, choose **Create Filter**\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Alarms**, **Create Alarm**\.

1. In the **Custom Metrics** section, choose the namespace for the metric filter that you created\.

   It can take a few minutes for a new metric to display in the console\.

1. Select the metric name that you created, and choose **Next**\.

1. Enter a name and description for the alarm\. For the **is** fields, choose **>=** and enter **10**\. For the **for** field, leave the default **1** for the consecutive periods\.

1. For **Period**, choose **1 Hour**\. For **Statistic**, choose **Sum**\. The `Sum` statistic ensures that you are capturing the total number of data points for the specified time period\. 

1. In the **Actions** section, you can choose to send a notification to an existing list\. Or, you can create a new list and enter the email addresses that should receive a notification when the alarm is triggered\. When you are done, choose **Create Alarm**\.
