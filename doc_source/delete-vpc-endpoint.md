# Delete a VPC endpoint<a name="delete-vpc-endpoint"></a>

If you no longer require an endpoint, you can delete it\. Deleting a gateway endpoint also deletes the endpoint routes in the route tables that were used by the endpoint, but doesn't affect any security groups associated with the VPC in which the endpoint resides\. Deleting an interface endpoint or Gateway Load Balancer endpoint also deletes the endpoint network interfaces\.

A Gateway Load Balancer endpoint cannot be deleted if there are routes in your route tables that point to the endpoint\.
