# Carrier gateways<a name="Carrier_Gateway"></a>

A carrier gateway serves two purposes\. It allows inbound traffic from a carrier network in a specific location, and it allows outbound traffic to the carrier network and the internet\. There is no inbound connection configuration from the internet to a Wavelength Zone through the carrier gateway\. 

A carrier gateway supports IPv4 traffic\. 

Carrier gateways are only available for VPCs that contain subnets in a Wavelength Zone\. The carrier gateway provides connectivity between your Wavelength Zone and the telecommunication carrier, and devices on the telecommunication carrier network\. The carrier gateway performs NAT of the Wavelength instances' IP addresses to the Carrier IP addresses from a pool that is assigned to the network border group\. The carrier gateway NAT function is similar to how an internet gateway functions in a Region\.

## Enabling access to the telecommunication carrier network<a name="enabling-telecom-routing"></a>

To enable access to or from the telecommunication carrier network for instances in a Wavelength subnet, you must do the following:
+ Create a VPC\.
+ Create a carrier gateway and attach the carrier gateway to your VPC\. When you create the carrier gateway, you can optionally choose which subnets route to the carrier gateway\. When you select this option, we automatically create the resources related to carrier gateways, such as route tables and network ACLs\. If you do not choose this option, then you must perform the following tasks: 
  + Select the subnets that route traffic to the carrier gateway\.
  + Ensure that your subnet route tables have a route that directs traffic to the carrier gateway\.
  + Ensure that instances in your subnet have a globally unique Carrier IP address\.
  + Ensure that your network access control lists and security group rules allow the relevant traffic to flow to and from your instance\.

## Working with carrier gateways<a name="working-with-cgw"></a>

The following sections describe how to manually create a carrier gateway for your VPC to support inbound traffic from the carrier network \(for example, mobile phones\), and to support outbound traffic to the carrier network and the internet\.

### Create a VPC<a name="Add_CGW_Create_VPC"></a>

You can create an empty Wavelength VPC using the Amazon VPC console, or the AWS CLI\.

------
#### [ Amazon VPC console ]

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Your VPCs**, **Create VPC**\.

1. Specify the following VPC details as necessary and then choose **Create**\. 
   + **Name tag**: Optionally provide a name for your VPC\. Doing so creates a tag with a key of `Name` and the value that you specify\.
   + **IPv4 CIDR block**: Specify an IPv4 CIDR block for the VPC\. We recommend that you specify a CIDR block from the private \(non\-publicly routable\) IP address ranges as specified in [RFC 1918](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1918.html); for example, `10.0.0.0/16`, or `192.168.0.0/16`\. 
**Note**  
You can specify a range of publicly routable IPv4 addresses\. However, we currently do not support direct access to the internet from publicly routable CIDR blocks in a VPC\. Windows instances cannot boot correctly if launched into a VPC with ranges from `224.0.0.0` to `255.255.255.255` \(Class D and Class E IP address ranges\)\. 

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

**To create a VPC**
+ Use `create-vpc`\. For more information, see [create\-vpc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-vpc.html) in the* AWS CLI Command Reference*\.

------

### Create a carrier gateway<a name="Add_CGW_create_Gateway"></a>

After you create a VPC, create a carrier gateway and then select the subnets that route traffic to the carrier gateway\.

If you have not opted in to a Wavelength Zone, the Amazon VPC Console prompts you to opt in\. For more information, see [Manage Zones](#manage-zones)\.

When you choose to automatically route traffic from subnets to the carrier gateway, we create the following resources:
+ A carrier gateway
+ A subnet\. You can optionally assign all carrier gateway tags that do not have a **Key** value of `Name` to the subnet\.
+ A network ACL with the following resources:
  + A subnet associated with the subnet in the Wavelength Zone
  + Default inbound and outbound rules for all of your traffic\.
+ A route table with the following resources:
  + A route for all local traffic
  + A route that routes all non\-local traffic to the carrier gateway
  + An association with the subnet

------
#### [ Amazon VPC console ]

**To create a carrier gateway**

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Carrier Gateways**, and then choose **Create carrier gateway**\.

1. Optional: For **Name**, enter a name for the carrier gateway\.

1. For **VPC**, choose the VPC\.

1. Choose **Route subnet traffic to carrier gateway**, and under **Subnets to route** do the following\.

   1. Under **Existing subnets in Wavelength Zone**, select the box for each subnet to route to the carrier gateway\.

   1. To create a subnet in the Wavelength Zone, choose **Add new subnet**, specify the following information, and then choose **Add new subnet**:
      + **Name tag**: Optionally provide a name for your subnet\. Doing so creates a tag with a key of `Name` and the value that you specify\.
      + **VPC**: Choose the VPC\.
      + **Availability Zone**: Choose the Wavelength Zone\. 
      + **IPv4 CIDR block**: Specify an IPv4 CIDR block for your subnet, for example, `10.0.1.0/24`\.
      + To apply the carrier gateway tags to the subnet, select **Apply same tags from this carrier gateway**\.

1. \(Optional\) To add a tag to the carrier gateway, choose **Add tag**, and then do the following:
   + For **Key**, enter the key name\.
   + For **Value**, enter the key value\.

1. Choose **Create carrier gateway**\.

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

**To create a carrier gateway**
+ Use `create-carrier-gateway`\. For more information, see [create\-carrier\-gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-carrier-gateway.html) in the* AWS CLI Command Reference*\.

  After you create the carrier gateway, add a VPC route table with the following resources:
  + A route for all VPC local traffic
  + A route that routes all non\-local traffic to the carrier gateway
  + An association with the subnets in the Wavelength Zone

  For more information, see [Routing to A Wavelength Zone carrier gateway](route-table-options.md#route-tables-cgw) and [Working with route tables](WorkWithRouteTables.md)\.

### Create a security group to access the telecommunication carrier network<a name="Add_CGW_Security_Groups"></a>

By default, a VPC security group allows all outbound traffic\. You can create a new security group and add rules that allow inbound traffic from the telecommunication carrier\. Then, you associate the security group with instances in the subnet\.

------
#### [ Amazon VPC console ]

**To create a new security group and associate it with your instances**

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Security Groups**, and then choose **Create Security Group**\.

1. To create a security group, choose **Create security group**, specify the following information, and then choose **create**:
   + **Security group name**: Enter a name for the subnet\.
   + **Description**: Enter the security group description\.
   + **VPC**: Choose the VPC\.

1. Select the security group\. The details pane displays the details for the security group, plus tabs for working with its inbound rules and outbound rules\.

1. On the **Inbound Rules** tab, choose **Edit**\. Choose **Add Rule**, and complete the required information\. For example, select **HTTP** or **HTTPS** from the **Type** list, and enter the **Source** as `0.0.0.0/0` for IPv4 traffic, or `::/0` for IPv6 traffic\. Choose **Save**\.

### Allocate and associate a Carrier IP address with the instance in the Wavelength Zone subnet<a name="wavelength-allocate-carrier-ip"></a>

If you used the Amazon EC2 console to launch the instance, or you did not use the `associate-carrier-ip-address` option in the AWS CLI, then you must allocate a Carrier IP address and assign it to the instance: 

**To allocate and associate a Carrier IP address**

1. Use `allocate-address` to allocate a Carrier IP address\. For more information, see [allocate\-address](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/allocate-address.html) in the *AWS CLI Command Reference*\.

   Example

   ```
   aws ec2 allocate-address --region us-east-1 --domain vpc --network-border-group us-east-1-wl1-bos-wlz-1
   ```

   Output

   ```
   {
       "AllocationId": "eipalloc-05807b62acEXAMPLE",
       "PublicIpv4Pool": "amazon",
       "NetworkBorderGroup": "us-east-1-wl1-bos-wlz-1",
       "Domain": "vpc",
       "CarrierIp": "155.146.10.111"
   
   }
   ```

1. Use `associate-address` to associate the Carrier IP address with the EC2 instance\. For more information, see [associate\-address](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/associate-address.html) in the *AWS CLI Command Reference*\.

   Example

   ```
   aws ec2 associate-address --allocation-id eipalloc-05807b62acEXAMPLE --network-interface-id eni-1a2b3c4d
   ```

   Output

   ```
   {
       "AssociationId": "eipassoc-02463d08ceEXAMPLE",
   }
   ```
