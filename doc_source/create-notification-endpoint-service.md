# Create and manage a notification for an endpoint service<a name="create-notification-endpoint-service"></a>

You can create a notification to receive alerts for specific events that occur on the endpoints that are attached to your endpoint service\. For example, you can receive an email when an endpoint request is accepted or rejected for your endpoint service\. To create a notification, you must associate an Amazon SNS topic with the notification\. You can subscribe to the SNS topic to receive an email notification when an endpoint event occurs\. For more information, see the [Amazon Simple Notification Service Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/)\.

The Amazon SNS topic that you use for notifications must have a topic policy that allows the Amazon VPC endpoint service to publish notifications on your behalf\. Ensure that you include the following statement in your topic policy\. For more information, see [Managing Access to Your Amazon SNS Topics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/AccessPolicyLanguage.html) in the *Amazon Simple Notification Service Developer Guide*\.
