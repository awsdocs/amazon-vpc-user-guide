# Comparing NAT gateways and NAT instances<a name="vpc-nat-comparison"></a>

The following is a high\-level summary of the differences between NAT instances and NAT gateways\.


| Attribute | NAT gateway | NAT instance | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Availability | Highly available\. NAT gateways in each Availability Zone are implemented with redundancy\. Create a NAT gateway in each Availability Zone to ensure zone\-independent architecture\. | Use a script to manage failover between instances\. | 
| Bandwidth | Can scale up to 45 Gbps\. | Depends on the bandwidth of the instance type\. | 
| Maintenance | Managed by AWS\. You do not need to perform any maintenance\. | Managed by you, for example, by installing software updates or operating system patches on the instance\. | 
| Performance | Software is optimized for handling NAT traffic\. | A generic Amazon Linux AMI that's configured to perform NAT\. | 
| Cost | Charged depending on the number of NAT gateways you use, duration of usage, and amount of data that you send through the NAT gateways\. | Charged depending on the number of NAT instances that you use, duration of usage, and instance type and size\. | 
| Type and size | Uniform offering; you donâ€™t need to decide on the type or size\.  | Choose a suitable instance type and size, according to your predicted workload\. | 
| Public IP addresses | Choose the Elastic IP address to associate with a NAT gateway at creation\. | Use an Elastic IP address or a public IP address with a NAT instance\. You can change the public IP address at any time by associating a new Elastic IP address with the instance\. | 
| Private IP addresses | Automatically selected from the subnet's IP address range when you create the gateway\. | Assign a specific private IP address from the subnet's IP address range when you launch the instance\. | 
| Security groups | Cannot be associated with a NAT gateway\. You can associate security groups with your resources behind the NAT gateway to control inbound and outbound traffic\. | Associate with your NAT instance and the resources behind your NAT instance to control inbound and outbound traffic\. | 
| Network ACLs | Use a network ACL to control the traffic to and from the subnet in which your NAT gateway resides\. | Use a network ACL to control the traffic to and from the subnet in which your NAT instance resides\. | 
| Flow logs | Use flow logs to capture the traffic\. | Use flow logs to capture the traffic\. | 
| Port forwarding | Not supported\. | Manually customize the configuration to support port forwarding\. | 
| Bastion servers | Not supported\. | Use as a bastion server\. | 
| Traffic metrics | View [CloudWatch metrics for the NAT gateway](vpc-nat-gateway-cloudwatch.md)\. | View CloudWatch metrics for the instance\. | 
| Timeout behavior | When a connection times out, a NAT gateway returns an RST packet to any resources behind the NAT gateway that attempt to continue the connection \(it does not send a FIN packet\)\. | When a connection times out, a NAT instance sends a FIN packet to resources behind the NAT instance to close the connection\. | 
| IP fragmentation | Supports forwarding of IP fragmented packets for the UDP protocol\. Does not support fragmentation for the TCP and ICMP protocols\. Fragmented packets for these protocols will get dropped\.  | Supports reassembly of IP fragmented packets for the UDP, TCP, and ICMP protocols\. |
