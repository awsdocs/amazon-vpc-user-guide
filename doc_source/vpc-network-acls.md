# Network ACLs<a name="vpc-network-acls"></a>

A *network access control list \(ACL\)* is an optional layer of security for your VPC that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more subnets\. You might set up network ACLs with rules similar to your security groups in order to add an additional layer of security to your VPC\. For more information about the differences between security groups and network ACLs, see [Comparison of security groups and network ACLs](VPC_Security.md#VPC_Security_Comparison)\.

## Network ACL basics<a name="nacl-basics"></a>

The following are the basic things that you need to know about network ACLs:
+ Your VPC automatically comes with a modifiable default network ACL\. By default, it allows all inbound and outbound IPv4 traffic and, if applicable, IPv6 traffic\.
+ You can create a custom network ACL and associate it with a subnet\. By default, each custom network ACL denies all inbound and outbound traffic until you add rules\. 
+ Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a network ACL\. If you don't explicitly associate a subnet with a network ACL, the subnet is automatically associated with the default network ACL\.
+ You can associate a network ACL with multiple subnets\. However, a subnet can be associated with only one network ACL at a time\. When you associate a network ACL with a subnet, the previous association is removed\.
+ A network ACL contains a numbered list of rules\. We evaluate the rules in order, starting with the lowest numbered rule, to determine whether traffic is allowed in or out of any subnet associated with the network ACL\. The highest number that you can use for a rule is 32766\. We recommend that you start by creating rules in increments \(for example, increments of 10 or 100\) so that you can insert new rules where you need to later on\.
+ A network ACL has separate inbound and outbound rules, and each rule can either allow or deny traffic\. 
+ Network ACLs are stateless, which means that responses to allowed inbound traffic are subject to the rules for outbound traffic \(and vice versa\)\.

There are quotas \(limits\) for the number of network ACLs per VPC, and the number of rules per network ACL\. For more information, see [Amazon VPC quotas](amazon-vpc-limits.md)\.

## Network ACL rules<a name="nacl-rules"></a>

You can add or remove rules from the default network ACL, or create additional network ACLs for your VPC\. When you add or remove rules from a network ACL, the changes are automatically applied to the subnets that it's associated with\.

The following are the parts of a network ACL rule:
+ **Rule number**\. Rules are evaluated starting with the lowest numbered rule\. As soon as a rule matches traffic, it's applied regardless of any higher\-numbered rule that might contradict it\.
+ **Type**\. The type of traffic; for example, SSH\. You can also specify all traffic or a custom range\.
+ **Protocol**\. You can specify any protocol that has a standard protocol number\. For more information, see [Protocol Numbers](http://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml)\. If you specify ICMP as the protocol, you can specify any or all of the ICMP types and codes\.
+ **Port range**\. The listening port or port range for the traffic\. For example, 80 for HTTP traffic\.
+ **Source**\. \[Inbound rules only\] The source of the traffic \(CIDR range\)\.
+ **Destination**\. \[Outbound rules only\] The destination for the traffic \(CIDR range\)\.
+ **Allow/Deny**\. Whether to *allow* or *deny* the specified traffic\.

If you add a rule using a command line tool or the Amazon EC2 API, the CIDR range is automatically modified to its canonical form\. For example, if you specify `100.68.0.18/18` for the CIDR range, we create a rule with a `100.68.0.0/18` CIDR range\.

## Default network ACL<a name="default-network-acl"></a>

The default network ACL is configured to allow all traffic to flow in and out of the subnets with which it is associated\. Each network ACL also includes a rule whose rule number is an asterisk\. This rule ensures that if a packet doesn't match any of the other numbered rules, it's denied\. You can't modify or remove this rule\. 

The following is an example default network ACL for a VPC that supports IPv4 only\.


| 
| 
| **Inbound ** | 
| --- |
| Rule \# | Type |  Protocol |  Port range  | Source |  Allow/Deny | 
|  100  | All IPv4 traffic |  All  |  All  | 0\.0\.0\.0/0 |  ALLOW  | 
|  \*  | All IPv4 traffic |  All  |  All  | 0\.0\.0\.0/0 |  DENY  | 
|  **Outbound**  | 
| --- |
| Rule \# | Type |  Protocol  |  Port range | Destination |  Allow/Deny | 
|  100  | All IPv4 traffic |  All  |  All  | 0\.0\.0\.0/0 |  ALLOW  | 
|  \*  | All IPv4 traffic |  All  |  All  | 0\.0\.0\.0/0 |  DENY  | 

If you create a VPC with an IPv6 CIDR block or if you associate an IPv6 CIDR block with your existing VPC, we automatically add rules that allow all IPv6 traffic to flow in and out of your subnet\. We also add rules whose rule numbers are an asterisk that ensures that a packet is denied if it doesn't match any of the other numbered rules\. You can't modify or remove these rules\. The following is an example default network ACL for a VPC that supports IPv4 and IPv6\.

**Note**  
If you've modified your default network ACL's inbound rules, we do not automatically add an *allow* rule for inbound IPv6 traffic when you associate an IPv6 block with your VPC\. Similarly, if you've modified the outbound rules, we do not automatically add an *allow* rule for outbound IPv6 traffic\. 


| 
| 
| **Inbound ** | 
| --- |
| Rule \# | Type |  Protocol |  Port range  | Source |  Allow/Deny | 
|  100  | All IPv4 traffic |  All  |  All  | 0\.0\.0\.0/0 |  ALLOW  | 
|  101  |  All IPv6 traffic  |  All  |  All  |  ::/0  |  ALLOW  | 
|  \*  | All traffic |  All  |  All  | 0\.0\.0\.0/0 |  DENY  | 
|  \*  |  All IPv6 traffic  |  All  |  All  |  ::/0  |  DENY  | 
|  **Outbound**  | 
| --- |
| Rule \# | Type |  Protocol  |  Port range | Destination |  Allow/Deny | 
|  100  | All traffic |  All  |  All  | 0\.0\.0\.0/0 |  ALLOW  | 
|  101  |  All IPv6 traffic  |  All  |  All  |  ::/0  |  ALLOW  | 
|  \*  | All traffic |  All  |  All  | 0\.0\.0\.0/0 |  DENY  | 
|  \*  |  All IPv6 traffic  |  All  |  All  |  ::/0  |  DENY  | 

## Custom network ACL<a name="custom-network-acl"></a>

The following table shows an example of a custom network ACL for a VPC that supports IPv4 only\. It includes rules that allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic in \(inbound rules 100 and 110\)\. There's a corresponding outbound rule that enables responses to that inbound traffic \(outbound rule 140, which covers ephemeral ports 32768\-65535\)\. For more information about how to select the appropriate ephemeral port range, see [Ephemeral ports](#nacl-ephemeral-ports)\.

The network ACL also includes inbound rules that allow SSH and RDP traffic into the subnet\. The outbound rule 120 enables responses to leave the subnet\.

The network ACL has outbound rules \(100 and 110\) that allow outbound HTTP and HTTPS traffic out of the subnet\. There's a corresponding inbound rule that enables responses to that outbound traffic \(inbound rule 140, which covers ephemeral ports 32768\-65535\)\. 

**Note**  
Each network ACL includes a default rule whose rule number is an asterisk\. This rule ensures that if a packet doesn't match any of the other rules, it's denied\. You can't modify or remove this rule\.

|  Rule \#  | Type |  Protocol  |  Port range  | Source  |  Allow/Deny  |  Comments  | 
|  100  | HTTP |  TCP  |  80  | 0\.0\.0\.0/0 |  ALLOW  |  Allows inbound HTTP traffic from any IPv4 address\.  | 
|  110  | HTTPS |  TCP  |  443  | 0\.0\.0\.0/0 |  ALLOW  |  Allows inbound HTTPS traffic from any IPv4 address\.  | 
|  120  | SSH |  TCP  |  22  | 192\.0\.2\.0/24 |  ALLOW  |  Allows inbound SSH traffic from your home network's public IPv4 address range \(over the internet gateway\)\.  | 
|  130  | RDP |  TCP  |  3389  | 192\.0\.2\.0/24 |  ALLOW  |  Allows inbound RDP traffic to the web servers from your home network's public IPv4 address range \(over the internet gateway\)\.   | 
|  140  | Custom TCP |  TCP  |  32768\-65535  | 0\.0\.0\.0/0 |  ALLOW  |  Allows inbound return IPv4 traffic from the internet \(that is, for requests that originate in the subnet\)\. This range is an example only\. For more information about how to select the appropriate ephemeral port range, see [Ephemeral ports](#nacl-ephemeral-ports)\.  | 
|  \*  | All traffic |  All  |  All  | 0\.0\.0\.0/0 |  DENY  |  Denies all inbound IPv4 traffic not already handled by a preceding rule \(not modifiable\)\.  | 
|  **Outbound**  | 
| --- |
|  Rule \#  | Type |  Protocol  |  Port range  | Destination |  Allow/Deny  |  Comments  | 
|  100  | HTTP |  TCP  |  80  | 0\.0\.0\.0/0 |  ALLOW  |  Allows outbound IPv4 HTTP traffic from the subnet to the internet\.  | 
|  110  | HTTPS |  TCP  |  443  | 0\.0\.0\.0/0 |  ALLOW  |  Allows outbound IPv4 HTTPS traffic from the subnet to the internet\.  | 
| 120 | SSH |  TCP  |  22  | 192\.0\.2\.0/24 |  ALLOW  |  Allows outbound SSH traffic from your home network's public IPv4 address range \(over the internet gateway\)\.  | 
|  140  | Custom TCP |  TCP  |  32768\-65535  | 0\.0\.0\.0/0 |  ALLOW  |  Allows outbound IPv4 responses to clients on the internet \(for example, serving webpages to people visiting the web servers in the subnet\)\. This range is an example only\. For more information about how to select the appropriate ephemeral port range, see [Ephemeral ports](#nacl-ephemeral-ports)\.  | 
|  \*  | All traffic |  All  |  All  | 0\.0\.0\.0/0 |  DENY  |  Denies all outbound IPv4 traffic not already handled by a preceding rule \(not modifiable\)\.  | 

As a packet comes to the subnet, we evaluate it against the inbound rules of the ACL that the subnet is associated with \(starting at the top of the list of rules, and moving to the bottom\)\. Here's how the evaluation goes if the packet is destined for the HTTPS port \(443\)\. The packet doesn't match the first rule evaluated \(rule 100\)\. It does match the second rule \(110\), which allows the packet into the subnet\. If the packet had been destined for port 139 \(NetBIOS\), it doesn't match any of the rules, and the \* rule ultimately denies the packet\. 

You might want to add a *deny* rule in a situation where you legitimately need to open a wide range of ports, but there are certain ports within the range that you want to deny\. Just make sure to place the *deny* rule earlier in the table than the rule that allows the wide range of port traffic\.

You add *allow* rules depending on your use case\. For example, you can add a rule that allows outbound TCP and UDP access on port 53 for DNS resolution\. For every rule that you add, ensure that there is a corresponding inbound or outbound rule that allows response traffic\.

The following table shows the same example of a custom network ACL for a VPC that has an associated IPv6 CIDR block\. This network ACL includes rules for all IPv6 HTTP and HTTPS traffic\. In this case, new rules were inserted between the existing rules for IPv4 traffic\. You can also add the rules as higher number rules after the IPv4 rules\. IPv4 and IPv6 traffic are separate, and therefore none of the rules for the IPv4 traffic apply to the IPv6 traffic\.

## Custom network ACLs and other AWS services<a name="nacl-other-services"></a>

If you create a custom network ACL, be aware of how it might affect resources that you create using other AWS services\.

With Elastic Load Balancing, if the subnet for your backend instances has a network ACL in which you've added a *deny* rule for all traffic with a source of either `0.0.0.0/0` or the subnet's CIDR, your load balancer can't carry out health checks on the instances\. For more information about the recommended network ACL rules for your load balancers and backend instances, see [Network ACLs for Load Balancers in a VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/elb-security-groups.html#elb-vpc-nacl) in the *User Guide for Classic Load Balancers*\.

## Ephemeral ports<a name="nacl-ephemeral-ports"></a>

The example network ACL in the preceding section uses an ephemeral port range of 32768\-65535\. However, you might want to use a different range for your network ACLs depending on the type of client that you're using or with which you're communicating\.

The client that initiates the request chooses the ephemeral port range\. The range varies depending on the client's operating system\. 
+ Many Linux kernels \(including the Amazon Linux kernel\) use ports 32768\-61000\.
+ Requests originating from Elastic Load Balancing use ports 1024\-65535\.
+ Windows operating systems through Windows Server 2003 use ports 1025\-5000\.
+ Windows Server 2008 and later versions use ports 49152\-65535\.
+ A NAT gateway uses ports 1024\-65535\.
+ AWS Lambda functions use ports 1024\-65535\.

For example, if a request comes into a web server in your VPC from a Windows 10 client on the internet, your network ACL must have an outbound rule to enable traffic destined for ports 49152\-65535\. 

If an instance in your VPC is the client initiating a request, your network ACL must have an inbound rule to enable traffic destined for the ephemeral ports specific to the type of instance \(Amazon Linux, Windows Server 2008, and so on\)\. 

In practice, to cover the different types of clients that might initiate traffic to public\-facing instances in your VPC, you can open ephemeral ports 1024\-65535\. However, you can also add rules to the ACL to deny traffic on any malicious ports within that range\. Ensure that you place the *deny* rules earlier in the table than the *allow* rules that open the wide range of ephemeral ports\.

## Path MTU Discovery<a name="path_mtu_discovery"></a>

Path MTU Discovery is used to determine the path MTU between two devices\. The path MTU is the maximum packet size that's supported on the path between the originating host and the receiving host\. 

For IPv4, when a host sends a packet that's larger than the MTU of the receiving host or that's larger than the MTU of a device along the path, the receiving host or device drops the packet, and then returns the following ICMP message: `Destination Unreachable: Fragmentation Needed and Don't Fragment was Set` \(Type 3, Code 4\)\. This instructs the transmitting host to split the payload into multiple smaller packets, and then retransmit them\. 

The IPv6 protocol does not support fragmentation in the network\. When a host sends a packet that's larger than the MTU of the receiving host or that's larger than the MTU of a device along the path, the receiving host or device drops the packet, and then returns the following ICMP message: `ICMPv6 Packet Too Big (PTB)` \(Type 2\)\. This instructs the transmitting host to split the payload into multiple smaller packets, and then retransmit them\. 

If the maximum transmission unit \(MTU\) between hosts in your subnets is different, or your instances communicate with peers over the internet, you must add the following network ACL rule, both inbound and outbound\. This ensures that Path MTU Discovery can function correctly and prevent packet loss\. Select **Custom ICMP Rule** for the type and **Destination Unreachable**, **fragmentation required, and DF flag set** for the port range \(type 3, code 4\)\. If you use traceroute, also add the following rule: select **Custom ICMP Rule** for the type and **Time Exceeded**, **TTL expired transit** for the port range \(type 11, code 0\)\. For more information, see [Network maximum transmission unit \(MTU\) for your EC2 instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/network_mtu.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.

## Working with network ACLs<a name="nacl-tasks"></a>

The following tasks show you how to work with network ACLs using the Amazon VPC console\.

+ [Creating a network ACL](#CreateACL)
+ [Adding and deleting rules](#Rules)
+ [Associating a subnet with a network ACL](#NetworkACL)
+ [Disassociating a network ACL from a subnet](#DisassociateNetworkACL)

### Determining network ACL associations<a name="ACLSubnet"></a>

You can use the Amazon VPC console to determine the network ACL that's associated with a subnet\. Network ACLs can be associated with more than one subnet, so you can also determine which subnets are associated with a network ACL\.

**To determine which network ACL is associated with a subnet**

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Subnets**, and then select the subnet\.

   The network ACL associated with the subnet is included in the **Network ACL** tab, along with the network ACL's rules\. 

**To determine which subnets are associated with a network ACL**

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Network ACLs**\. The **Associated With** column indicates the number of associated subnets for each network ACL\.

1. Select a network ACL\.

1. In the details pane, choose **Subnet Associations** to display the subnets that are associated with the network ACL\.

### Creating a network ACL<a name="CreateACL"></a>

You can create a custom network ACL for your VPC\. By default, a network ACL that you create blocks all inbound and outbound traffic until you add rules, and is not associated with a subnet until you explicitly associate it with one\.

**To create a network ACL**

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Network ACLs**\.

1. Choose **Create Network ACL**\.

1. In the **Create Network ACL** dialog box, optionally name your network ACL, and select the ID of your VPC from the **VPC** list\. Then choose **Yes, Create**\.

### Adding and deleting rules<a name="Rules"></a>

When you add or delete a rule from an ACL, any subnets that are associated with the ACL are subject to the change\. You don't have to terminate and relaunch the instances in the subnet\. The changes take effect after a short period\. 

If you're using the Amazon EC2 API or a command line tool, you can't modify rules\. You can only add and delete rules\. If you're using the Amazon VPC console, you can modify the entries for existing rules\. The console removes the existing rule and adds a new rule for you\. If you need to change the order of a rule in the ACL, you must add a new rule with the new rule number, and then delete the original rule\.

**To add rules to a network ACL**

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Network ACLs**\.

1. In the details pane, choose either the **Inbound Rules** or **Outbound Rules** tab, depending on the type of rule that you need to add, and then choose **Edit**\.

1. In **Rule \#**, enter a rule number \(for example, 100\)\. The rule number must not already be in use in the network ACL\. We process the rules in order, starting with the lowest number\.

   We recommend that you leave gaps between the rule numbers \(such as 100, 200, 300\), rather than using sequential numbers \(101, 102, 103\)\. This makes it easier add a new rule without having to renumber the existing rules\.

1. Select a rule from the **Type** list\. For example, to add a rule for HTTP, choose **HTTP**\. To add a rule to allow all TCP traffic, choose **All TCP**\. For some of these options \(for example, HTTP\), we fill in the port for you\. To use a protocol that's not listed, choose **Custom Protocol Rule**\.

1. \(Optional\) If you're creating a custom protocol rule, select the protocol's number and name from the **Protocol** list\. For more information, see [IANA List of Protocol Numbers](http://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml)\.

1. \(Optional\) If the protocol you selected requires a port number, enter the port number or port range separated by a hyphen \(for example, 49152\-65535\)\. 

1. In the **Source** or **Destination** field \(depending on whether this is an inbound or outbound rule\), enter the CIDR range that the rule applies to\.

1. From the **Allow/Deny** list, select **ALLOW** to allow the specified traffic or **DENY** to deny the specified traffic\.

1. \(Optional\) To add another rule, choose **Add another rule**, and repeat steps 4 to 9 as required\. 

1. When you are done, choose **Save**\.

**To delete a rule from a network ACL**

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Network ACLs**, and then select the network ACL\.

1. In the details pane, select either the **Inbound Rules** or **Outbound Rules** tab, and then choose **Edit**\. Choose **Remove** for the rule you want to delete, and then choose **Save**\.

### Associating a subnet with a network ACL<a name="NetworkACL"></a>

To apply the rules of a network ACL to a particular subnet, you must associate the subnet with the network ACL\. You can associate a network ACL with multiple subnets\. However, a subnet can be associated with only one network ACL\. Any subnet that is not associated with a particular ACL is associated with the default network ACL by default\.

**To associate a subnet with a network ACL**

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Network ACLs**, and then select the network ACL\.

1. In the details pane, on the **Subnet Associations** tab, choose **Edit**\. Select the **Associate** check box for the subnet to associate with the network ACL, and then choose **Save**\.

### Disassociating a network ACL from a subnet<a name="DisassociateNetworkACL"></a>

You can disassociate a custom network ACL from a subnet\. When the subnet has been disassociated from the custom network ACL, it is then automatically associated with the default network ACL\.

**To disassociate a subnet from a network ACL**

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Network ACLs**, and then select the network ACL\.

1. In the details pane, choose the **Subnet Associations** tab\.

1. Choose **Edit**, and then deselect the **Associate** check box for the subnet\. Choose **Save**\.

### Changing a subnet's network ACL<a name="ChangeNetworkACL"></a>

You can change the network ACL that's associated with a subnet\. For example, when you create a subnet, it is initially associated with the default network ACL\. You might want to instead associate it with a custom network ACL that you've created\.

After changing a subnet's network ACL, you don't have to terminate and relaunch the instances in the subnet\. The changes take effect after a short period\. 

**To change a subnet's network ACL association**

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Subnets**, and then select the subnet\.

1. Choose the **Network ACL** tab, and then choose **Edit**\.

## Example: Controlling access to instances in a subnet<a name="nacl-examples"></a>

In this example, instances in your subnet can communicate with each other, and are accessible from a trusted remote computer\. The remote computer might be a computer in your local network or an instance in a different subnet or VPC\. You use it to connect to your instances to perform administrative tasks\. Your security group rules and network ACL rules allow access from the IP address of your remote computer \(172\.31\.1\.2/32\)\. All other traffic from the internet or other networks is denied\.

![\[Using a security group and an NACL\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/images/nacl-example-diagram.png)

All instances use the same security group \(sg\-1a2b3c4d\), with the following rules\.


|  | 
| --- |
| Inbound rules | 
| Protocol Type | Protocol | Port range | Source | Comments | 
| All traffic | All | All | sg\-1a2b3c4d | Enables instances that are associated with the same security group to communicate with each other\. | 
| SSH | TCP | 22 | 172\.31\.1\.2/32 | Allows inbound SSH access from the remote computer\. If the instance is a Windows computer, this rule must use the RDP protocol for port 3389 instead\. | 
| Outbound rules | 
| Protocol Type | Protocol | Port range | Destination | Comments | 
| All traffic | All | All | sg\-1a2b3c4d | Enables instances that are associated with the same security group to communicate with each other\. Security groups are stateful\. Therefore you don't need a rule that allows response traffic for inbound requests\. | 

The subnet is associated with a network ACL that has the following rules\.


|  | 
| --- |
| Inbound rules | 
| Rule \# | Type | Protocol | Port range | Source | Allow/Deny | Comments | 
| 100 | SSH | TCP | 22 | 172\.31\.1\.2/32 | ALLOW | Allows inbound traffic from the remote computer\. If the instance is a Windows computer, this rule must use the RDP protocol for port 3389 instead\. | 
| \* | All traffic | All | All | 0\.0\.0\.0/0 | DENY | Denies all other inbound traffic that does not match the previous rule\. | 
| Outbound rules | 
| Rule \# | Type | Protocol | Port range | Destination | Allow/Deny | Comments | 
| 100 | Custom TCP | TCP | 1024\-65535 | 172\.31\.1\.2/32 | ALLOW | Allows outbound responses to the remote computer\. Network ACLs are stateless\. Therefore this rule is required to allow response traffic for inbound requests\. | 
| \* | All traffic | All | All | 0\.0\.0\.0/0 | DENY | Denies all other outbound traffic that does not match the previous rule\. | 

This scenario gives you the flexibility to change the security groups or security group rules for your instances, and have the network ACL as the backup layer of defense\. The network ACL rules apply to all instances in the subnet\. If you accidentally make your security group rules too permissive, the network ACL rules continue to permit access only from the single IP address\. For example, the following rules are more permissive than the earlier rules: they allow inbound SSH access from any IP address\. 


|  | 
| --- |
| Inbound rules | 
| Type | Protocol | Port range | Source | Comments | 
| All traffic | All | All | sg\-1a2b3c4d | Enables instances that are associated with the same security group to communicate with each other\. | 
| SSH | TCP | 22 | 0\.0\.0\.0/0 | Allows SSH access from any IP address\. | 
| Outbound rules | 
| Type | Protocol | Port range | Destination | Comments | 
| All traffic | All | All | 0\.0\.0\.0/0 | Allows all outbound traffic\. | 

However, only other instances within the subnet and your remote computer are able to access this instance\. The network ACL rules still prevent all inbound traffic to the subnet except from your remote computer\.

## Recommended rules for VPC wizard scenarios<a name="vpc-recommended-nacl-rules"></a>

You can use the VPC wizard in the Amazon VPC console to implement common scenarios for Amazon VPC\. If you implement these scenarios as described in the documentation, you use the default network access control list \(ACL\), which allows all inbound and outbound traffic\. If you need an additional layer of security, you can create a network ACL and add rules\. For more information, see one of the following:
+ [Recommended network ACL rules for a VPC with a single public subnet](VPC_Scenario1.md#nacl-rules-scenario-1)
+ [Recommended network ACL rules for a VPC with public and private subnets \(NAT\)](VPC_Scenario2.md#nacl-rules-scenario-2)
+ [Recommended network ACL rules for a VPC with public and private subnets and AWS Site\-to\-Site VPN access](VPC_Scenario3.md#nacl-rules-scenario-3)
+ [Recommended network ACL rules for a VPC with a private subnet only and AWS Site\-to\-Site VPN access](VPC_Scenario4.md#nacl-rules-scenario-4)
