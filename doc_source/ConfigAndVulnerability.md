# Configuration and Vulnerability Analysis in Amazon Virtual Private Cloud<a name="ConfigAndVulnerability"></a>

 Configuration and IT controls are a shared responsibility between AWS and you, our customer\. For more information, see the AWS [shared responsibility model](http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/)\. In addition to the shared responsibility model, VPC users should be aware of the following: 
+ It is the customer responsibility to patch their client applications with the relevant client side dependencies\.
+ Customers should consider penetration testing for NAT gateways and EC2 instances \(see [https://aws\.amazon\.com/security/penetration\-testing/](http://aws.amazon.com/security/penetration-testing/)\)\.
