# AWS PrivateLink and VPC endpoints<a name="endpoint-services-overview"></a>

AWS PrivateLink establishes private connectivity between virtual private clouds \(VPC\) and services hosted on AWS or on\-premises, without exposing data to the internet\.

A VPC endpoint enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by AWS PrivateLink without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection\. Instances in your VPC do not require public IP addresses to communicate with resources in the service\. Traffic between your VPC and the other service does not leave the Amazon network\.
